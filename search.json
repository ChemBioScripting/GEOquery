There had been the systemic expression differences in vitreous at the microarray level from PDR patients and IMH patients, and from PDR patients after anti-VEGF treatment and untreated PDR patients. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the majority of deaths in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, the determinants of plaque composition are unknown in this population. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the most abundant class of circulating small non-coding RNA (sncRNAs) regulating gene expression, participate in the development of atherosclerosis and represent promising biomarkers of CVD.

The mechanisms that generate this ‘unexplained’ phenotypic variation (UPV) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify neuronatin (NNAT) as a conserved factor that buffers against unexplained phenotypic variation. We find that Nnat deficiency in isogenic F1 mice triggers the emergence of a novel, bi-stable polyphenism, where isogenic littermates emerge into adulthood either ‘normal’ or ‘overgrown’, without intermediates. more... #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is continuum of disorders among which non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is particularly associated with a negative prognosis.

Here we unravel a fundamental role for exercise-responsive cytokines (exerkines) on skeletal muscle development and growth in individuals with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Acute exercise triggered an inflammatory response in skeletal muscle, concomitant with an infiltration of immune cells. more... #> 8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Metformin is one of the first-line drugs for clinical treatment of type II diabetes, and recent studies have found that metformin can inhibit the development of multiple malignant tumors. When metformin is combined with chemotherapeutic drugs to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma（HNSCC）, it can effectively enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to define the signaling pathways regulated by metformin in HNSCC, and the underlying mechanisms by which metformin sensitizes HNSCC chemotherapy. more... #> 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We investigate the effects of GLP-1 on diabetic cardiomyocytes (DCMs) model established by human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).

elevated risk of metabolic syndrome in the offspring.  Epigenetic alterations are a suspected mechanism. GDM has been associated with placental DNA methylation changes in some epigenome-wide association studies. It remains unclear which genes or pathways are affected, and whether any placental differential gene methylations are correlated to fetal growth or circulating metabolic health biomarkers. more... #> 15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Adipocytes are key regulators of human metabolism, and their dysfunction in insulin signaling is central to metabolic diseases including type II diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, the progression of insulin resistance into T2D is still poorly understood. This limited understanding is due, in part, to the dearth of suitable models of insulin signaling in human adipocytes. Traditionally, adipocyte models fail to recapitulate in vivo insulin signaling, possibly due to exposure to supraphysiological nutrient and hormone conditions. more... #> 16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In this dataset, we utilized the db/db, uninephrectomy and renin-hypertension mouse model.

Pathway and gene signature analyses were performed on RNA expression profiles of synovial biopsies to identify mechanisms that could discriminate among EULAR good, moderate and non-responders. more... #> 19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Abnormal mechanical load is a main risk factor of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), and cellular senescence is a pathological change in IDD. Additionally, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness promotes human nucleus pulposus cells (hNPCs) senescence. However, the molecular mechanism underlying mechano-induced cellular senescence and IDD progression is not yet fully elucidated. First, we demonstrated that mechano-stress promoted hNPCs senescence via NF-κB signaling. more... #> 20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Patients with NEUROGENIN3 mutations have enteric endocrinopathy and diabetes mellitus. We generated pluripotent stem cells from a patient’s fibroblasts to investigate if gene editing restores endocrine differentiation. Corrected cell lines differentiated into all pancreatic lineages while native cell lines failed to activate pancreatic progenitor and lineage determination genes, suggesting that the mutation disrupts pancreatic organogenesis and results in endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. more... #> 21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Among 226 morbidly obese patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery between 2013 and 2014 as part of the A Biological Atlas of Severe Obesity (ABOS) study (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01129297), 18 women who gave informed consent were recruited in this study for immunophenotyping and microarray analyses of omental adipose tissue (AT).

Both WT and KO β cells were obtained from FACS as positive for both INS and NKX6.1. Single cell RNA-seq results revealed that SLC30A8 is mainly involved in β cell maturation process, and further showed that SLC30A8 LOF accelerates β cell maturation and upregulates insulin secretion pathway in mature β cells. #> 26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The antisense non-coding RNA in the INK locus (ANRIL), which originates from the CDKN2A/B (INK4-ARF) locus, has been identified as a hotspot for genetic variants associated with cardiometabolic disease including coronary artery disease (CAD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We recently found that ANRIL abundance in human pancreatic islets was increased in donors carrying certain T2D risk-SNPs, and that a T2D risk-SNP located within exon2 of ANRIL conferred reduced beta cell proliferation index, pointing to a role for ANRIL in the regulation of T2D pathogenicity via an impact on insulin secretory capacity. more... #> 27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in diabetes related diseases.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) provide an excellent tool for disease modelling by subsequent directed differentiation toward desired pancreatic islet cells, but cellular phenotypes in terminally differentiated cells are notoriously difficult to detect. more... #> 42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Background:  Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the major causes for T2D-related disability and mortality. Notably, diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in most countries. Understanding epigenetic contributors to DN can provide novel insights into this complex disorder and lay the foundation for more effective monitoring tools and preventive interventions, critical for achieving the ultimate goal of improving patient care and reducing healthcare burden. #> 43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this study, we performed transcriptome gene expression profiling of kidney tissues in human renal proximal epithelial tubular cell line (HK-2) treated with high D-glucose (HG) for 7 days before the addition of 40 mM oxamate for a further 24 hours in the presence of HG.

Wolfram syndrome (WS) mainly caused by WFS1 deficiency is a monogenic genetic disease manifested by severe psychiatric disorders. Due to athe lack of proper human disease models, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Particularly, whether and how WFS1 deficiency affects synapse formation remain elusive. more... #> 47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) usually has a preclinical phase identified by the presence of circulating autoantibodies to pancreatic islet antigens, and most young children who have multiple autoantibodies progress to diabetes within 10 years.

Until now, little is known about the transcriptional profile of human retinal microglia and how they differentiate from peripheral monocytes, as well as from brain microglia. Additionally, the degree to which mice are suitable models for human retinal microglia is still not clear. more... #> 51                             BACKGROUND.  The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) has significantly increased in recent decades and coincides with lifestyle changes that have likely altered the composition of the gut microbiota.  Dysbiosis and gut barrier dysfunction are associated with T1D, and notably, our studies have identified an inflammatory state in T1D families that is consistent microbial antigen exposure.     METHODS.  We conducted a 6-week, single-arm, open-label trial to investigate whether daily multi-strain probiotic (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus) supplementation could reduce the familial inflammatory state in 25 unaffected siblings of diabetes patients.    RESULTS.  Probiotic supplementation was found safe and well-tolerated; there were no adverse events and participant adherence was 93%.  Bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequencing of stool revealed that community alpha and beta diversity were not altered between the pre- and post-supplement samplings.  LEfSe analyses identified post-supplement enrichment of the family Lachnospiraceae, producers of the anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid butyrate.  Systemic inflammation was measured by plasma induced transcription and quantified with a gene ontology-based composite inflammatory index (I.I.com).  After supplementation, I.I.com was reduced (p=0.017), and pathway analysis predicted inhibition of IL17A, lipopolysaccharide, NFkB, IL1B, and TNF (Z-score≤-2.0) and activation of IL10RA (Z-score=2.0).  Post-supplement plasma levels of IL12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2, CCL24 were reduced (p<0.05), while butyrate levels trended 2.4-fold higher (p=0.06).    CONCLUSION.  There is a substantial need for safe, broadly applicable therapies to reduce T1D susceptibility.  This study indicates that investigations of prebiotic and probiotic strategies are warranted as they may be efficacious either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. #> 52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We used the latest technology, BD Rhapsody, to analyze the pairing of α and β chains that constitute the TCR of PBMCs from patients with type 1 diabetes at the single-cell level. #> 53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Background: Despite the established relation between energy restriction and metabolic health, the most beneficial nutrient composition of a weight-loss diet is still subject of debate.

Current treatment modalities for patients with CRC include surgery, which is often followed with adjuvant chemotherapy, especially in patients with a stage II and III disease. more... #> 57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We used WGCNA to construct a co‐expression network and obtain modules related to blood glucose, thus detecting key lncRNAs, and providing a reference for searching potential biomarkers of prediabetes and T2DM in hypertriglyceridemia patients. #> 58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A rare truncating p. Arg138* variant (R138X) in zinc transporter is associated with a 65% reduced risk for type 2 diabetes. To address the mechanism of how this variant protects from type 2 diabetes, we derived human pluripotent stem cells carrying this mutation and differentiated them into insulin-producing cells. We found that human pluripotent stem cells with R138X mutation and the null mutation have normal efficiency of differentiation towards insulin-producing cells, but these cells were depleted of zinc and presented large diffused insulin granules. more... #> 59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This study aimed to identify the crucial molecules and explore the function of noncoding RNAs and related pathways in IDD.

VAT CD206+CD11c− ATMs were increased in diabetic subjects, scavenger receptor-rich with low intracellular lipids, secreted proinflammatory cytokines, and diverged significantly from two CD11c+ ATM subtypes, which were lipid-laden, lipid antigen presenting, and overlapped with monocyte signatures. more... #> 67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Up until now, no study has looked specifically at epigenomic landscapes throughout twin samples, discordant for Anorexia nervosa (AN).

In this study, we quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation using the Infinium Human DNA Methylation EPIC BeadChip array (850K) in DNA samples isolated from whole blood collected from a group of 7 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for AN. more... #> 68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of blood samples collected from patients after diagnosis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (cases) vs. blood samples collected from healthy individuals without family history of cancer (controls).

Here we show that, among MYC family members, Mycl was expressed preferentially in proliferating immature endocrine cells. Genetic ablation of Mycl caused a modest reduction in cell proliferation of pancreatic endocrine cells in neonatal mice. By contrast, systemic expression of Mycl in mice stimulated proliferation in pancreatic islet cells and resulted in expansion of pancreatic islets without forming tumors in other organs. more... #> 71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Fibrous membrane (FM), the hallmark for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), can cause hemorrhages and retinal detachment, which may lead to blindness if not properly treated. However, little is known about the pathophysiology of FM.

High fat feeding and other metabolic stressors cause dramatic changes in adipose morphology, physiology, and cellular composition, and alterations in adiposity are associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). more... #> 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We report single-cell RNA-seq (Drop-seq) data from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). #> 84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Development of insulin resistance is a key pathogenic component underlying metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance are poorly understood. Genome-wide association studies for T2DM and other metabolic traits have led to the identification of many candidate SNPs, but the majority of these SNPs are noncoding and determination of associated causal genes and/or specific tissue sites of action have been difficult. more... #> 85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Background Changes in innate and adaptive immunity occurring in/around pancreatic islets had been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Caucasian T1D patients by some, but not all researchers.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are considered to be potent mediators of ECM loss. We reported previously that hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) inducer cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP) could attenuate the ECM breakdown which induced by IL-1β, however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. more... #> 91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Background. Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases tuberculosis (TB) severity. We previously reported baseline blood microarray data in a South Indian pulmonary TB cohort with or without DM, finding no qualitative or quantitative differences in immune pathway gene expression. To extend those observations, we compared baseline and longitudinal blood gene expression in TB patients from South India and Brazil. more... #> 92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Introduction.  Epigenetic modifications have been implicated to mediate several complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially nephropathy and retinopathy. Our aims were to ascertain if epigenetic alterations in whole blood discriminate among DM patients with normal, delayed and rapid gastric emptying (GE). Methods.  Using ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with next generation sequencing) assays, we compared the genome-wide enrichment of three histone modifications (ie, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in buffy coats from 20 DM patients with normal (n=6), delayed (n=8), or rapid (n=6) GE. more... #> 93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with cardiovascular-renal complications and premature death. Although most patients with T2D are obese, not all obese individuals develop T2D. Thus, an understanding of the mechanistic relationships between obesity and T2D is crucial. In this study, using subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissues (VAT) from obese individuals with or without T2D collected during metabolic surgery, integration of the transcriptomes and methylomes of VAT and SAT with publicly available tissue-specific regulatory networks, we discovered the close relation between T2D and inflammatory response in both SAT and VAT in obese individuals, although less differences were observed respectively in transcriptome or methylome. more... #> 94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Purpose:  The goals of this study is to compare and profile the smallRNA transcriptome of the placenta in preeclamptic and normal patients using RNA sequencing.

Several CVB serotypes can establish chronic infection in human cells in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanisms of leading to enterovirus persistency and, possibly, bell-cell autoimmunity are not fully understood. We established a carrier-state persistent infection model in human pancreatic ductal-like cell line PANC-1 using two distinct CVB1 strains and profiled infection-induced changes in cellular transcriptome. more... #> 98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Human islet antigen reactive CD4+ memory T cells (IAR T cells) play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D). Using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify T cell receptors (TCRs) in IAR T cells, we have identified a class of TCRs that share TCR alpha chains between individuals (“public”). #> 99                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Fungiform papillae (FP) are visible protrusions on the anterior tongue surface that contain taste buds, their nerves, and capillaries, epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune-surveilling cells. As FP are easily biopsied in a minimally invasive procedure and have been shown to regrow, we compared three different mechanical methods of FP protein extraction and found that mechanical disruption of FP under liquid nitrogen or bead beating were more efficient than mincing in terms of yield and proteomic profile. more... #> 100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Fetal progenitor endothelial cells (endothelial colony forming cells; ECFC) are recruited for repair, vascular growth and angiogenesis and their high abundance perinatally suggests a function in postnatal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. In this study we profiled ECFCs from pregnancies of control, overweight and diabetic mothers to study if adverse pregnancies are associated with epigenetic variation in ECFCs. #> 101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The establishment and function of the human placenta is dependent on specialized cells called trophoblasts. Unfortunately, little is known about the cellular and molecular processes controlling human trophoblast stem cell maintenance and differentiation into mature trophoblast sub-populations/cell states. To address this, we here report transcriptomic data from n=7 first trimester human placental tissues, n=3 regenerative human trophoblast stem cell (hTSC) derived trophoblast organoids, and n=3 EVT-differentiated hTSC derived organoid cultures at single-cell resolution. more... #> 102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Physical training improves insulin sensitivity and can prevent type 2 diabetes.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is associated with diabetic arterial media calcification. At the same time, long non-coding RNA(lncRNA) is closely related to the evolution of a variety of cardiovascular diseases, but the involvement of lncRNA in vascular calcification induced by DPP4 has not been reported in details. more... #> 105                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             MODY8 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 8) is a dominantly inherited monogenic form of diabetes associated with frameshift mutations in the carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) gene expressed by pancreatic acinar cells. Patients carrying the mutation develop childhood-onset exocrine pancreas dysfunction followed by the manifestation of diabetes during adulthood. However, it is unclear how CEL mutations cause diabetes. more... #> 106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Currently, no oral medications are available for individuals suffering from type 1 diabetes (T1D).

In particular, the high ratio of visceral AT depot (VAT) to abdominal subcutaneous AT depot (SAT) (high VAT/(VAT+SAT)) was associated with a metabolically unhealthy phenotype with high risk for insulin resistance and T2D. more... #> 108                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 109                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We conducted prospective clinical studies to validate the importance of CD4+ T cells in 13 diseases from the following ICD-10-CM chapters: Neoplasms (breast cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia);

We suggested miR-25-3p as possible common mediator in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and diabetes. #> 111                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication that may cause severe visual impairment and blindness in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Early detection of DR will provide opportunities for more treatment options and better control of disease progression.

The present study investigated, for the first time, whether muscle repair was altered in young adults with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes (T1D) following damaging exercise.In this cohort study, eighteen physically-active young adults (M=22.1, SEM=0.9 years) with T1D (n, male/female=4/5; MHbA1c= 58, SEMHbA1c=5.9 mmol/mol) and without T1D (n, male/female=4/5) performed 300 unilateral eccentric contractions (90°s-1) of the knee extensors. more... #> 125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a devastating complication of diabetes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms and cell types implicated in DFU healing, we used NanoString’s GeoMx Digital Spatial profiling platform on DFU tissue sections and compared gene expression of areas within the same ulcer as well as between patients who in 12 weeks following surgery healed their DFU (Healers, N=2) vs those who did not (Non-Healers, N=2). #> 126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely involved in gene transcription regulation and which act as epigenetic modifiers. To determine whether lncRNAs are involved in ischemic stroke (IS), we analyzed the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in IS. RNA sequencing was performed on the blood of three pairs of IS patients and heathy controls. Differential expression analysis was used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and mRNAs (DEmRNAs). more... #> 128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the molecular factors that cause this disproportiona increase in CVD in the DM/chronic kidney disease (CKD) population are still unknown.Human endothelial cells treated with high glucose to mimic DM and with the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) to mimic the endothelial injury associated with CKD. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in these conditions were analyzed by RNA sequencing.Lnc-SLC15A1-1 expression was significantly increased upon IS treatment versus high glucose alone. #> 129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is not fully understood.

When comparing patient fibroblasts to wild-type ones and using a significance level of false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, we identified 3394 transcripts of which 1849 were upregulated and 1545 were downregulated. #> 133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Heterozygous human INS gene mutations are known to promote ER stress, leading to β-cell dysfunction and neonatal diabetes. Recent literature challenged the long-standing notion that neonatal diabetes occurs due to ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis. Importantly, mechanisms of β-cell failure during the disease progression and why the other wild-type (WT) INS allele is unable to function still remain unclear. more... #> 134                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this study is to investigate alveolar bone gene expression in health and diabetes through RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. #> 135                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The mechanisms of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated impaired fracture healing are poorly studied. In a murine model of T2D reflecting both hyperinsulinemia induced by high fat diet (HFD) and insulinopenia induced by treatment with streptozotocin (STZ), we examined bone healing in a tibia cortical bone defect. A delayed bone healing was observed during hyperinsulinemia as newly formed bone was reduced by – 28.4±7.7% and was associated with accumulation of marrow adipocytes at the defect site +124.06±38.71%, and increased density of SCA1+ (+74.99± 29.19%) but not Runx2+osteoprogenitor cells. more... #> 136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is proposed that impaired expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), caused in part by an increase in adipose tissue fibrosis, redirects fatty acids to the liver and other organs, leading to ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. We therefore evaluated whether a decrease in SAT expandability, assessed by measuring SAT lipogenesis (triglyceride production), and an increase in SAT fibrogenesis (collagen production) are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance in people with obesity. more... #> 137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Retinal neovascularization is a severe complication of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We have previously identified that miRNAs is directly involved in the development of retinal neovascularization. Here, we explored the role of miRNAs and its underlying mechanism in modulating angiogenesis. #> 138                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Background: A previous Phase I study showed that the infusion of autologous Treg cells expanded ex-vivo into recent onset Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients had an excellent safety profile, however, the majority of the infused Tregs could no longer be detected in the peripheral blood three months post-infusion (NCT01210664-Treg-T1D Trial).

These changes in the transcriptome were absent or less pronounced in fat cells obtained from patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. more... #> 141                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Type 2 diabetes is a complex, systemic disease affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Previous research has identified genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes risk, however gene regulatory changes underlying progression to disease are still largely unknown. We investigated RNA expression changes that occur during diabetes progression using a two-stage approach. In our discovery stage, we compared changes in gene expression using two longitudinally collected blood samples from subjects who transitioned to type 2 diabetes between the time points against those who did not with a novel analytical network approach. more... #> 142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Free fatty acids (FFAs) are often stored in lipid droplet (LD) depots for eventual metabolic and/or synthetic use in many cell types, such a muscle, liver, and fat. In pancreatic islets, overt LD accumulation was detected in humans but not mice.

The molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage dysfunction and its control in diabetes are largely unexplored on an epigenetic level. Here, we report that acetyl histone-H3 (Lys27), an epigenetic mark regulating the macrophage transcriptome, is lost in the hostile tissue microenvironment in diabetes. more... #> 144                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Permutational analysis of immune landscape reveals advanced immune aging in people with Down syndrome and in people with type 1 diabetes. #> 145                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Islet-enriched transcription factors (TFs) exert broad control over cellular processes in pancreatic α and β cells and changes in their expression are associated with developmental state and diabetes.

Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first cells of the innate immune system that engage Mtb, but how HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) impact on the anti-mycobacterial response of AM is not known. more... #> 152                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Circular RNA can regulate blood glucose levels by targeting mRNA expression, but the role of circRNA in GDM is still unknown. Therefore, a joint microarray analysis of circRNAs and their targeting mRNAs using the peripheral blood of GDM patients and healthy pregnant women was carried out for the first time. In our study, high-throughput microarray sequencing technique was used to analyze the expression profile of circRNA and transcripts mRNA in the peripheral blood of GDM patients, in order to comprehensively evaluate the role of circRNAs targets and their parents genes in the signal pathways related to the pathogenesis of GDM. more... #> 153                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    To improve the power of mediation in high-throughput studies, here we introduce High-throughput mediation analysis (Hitman), which accounts for direction of mediation and applies empirical Bayesian linear modeling. We apply Hitman in a retrospective, exploratory analysis of the SLIMM-T2D clinical trial in which participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or nonsurgical diabetes/weight management, and fasting plasma proteome and metabolome were assayed up to 3 years. more... #> 154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective adipose tissue, extreme insulin resistance, and early onset of diabetes. There are four types of congenital generalized lipodystrophy based on the causative genetic alterations. The symptoms and the degrees of disease progression are varied among all affected individuals, which might be due to unknown genetic modifiers. more... #> 155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Circadian rhythms are generated by an auto-regulatory feedback loop composed of transcriptional activators and repressors. Disruption of circadian rhythms contributes to Type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis. We elucidated whether altered circadian rhythmicity of clock genes is associated with metabolic dysfunction in T2D.

To assess the role of hepatic GABA production in obesity-induced metabolic and energy dysregulation, we treated mice with two pharmacologic GABA-T inhibitors and also knocked down hepatic GABA-T expression using an antisense oligonucleotide. more... #> 162                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dysregulation of glucagon secretion in type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves hypersecretion during postprandial states, but insufficient secretion during hypoglycemia. The sympathetic nervous system regulates glucagon secretion. To investigate islet sympathetic innervation in T1D, sympathetic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) axons were analyzed in control non-diabetic organ donors, non-diabetic islet autoantibody-positive individuals (AAb), and age-matched persons with T1D. more... #> 163                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We employed a microarray as a discovery platform to identify the differential gene expressions between hND islets and hT2DM islets. 4805 genes with differential expression (fold change >2) were manifested in hT2DM islets. Inflammatory response and immune response were the mostly upregulated biological processes distinguished betwee hND islets and T2DM islets. Results provided insight into the molecular mechanisms in T2DM. #> 164                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Epidemiological evidence has identified an association between breast cancer (BC) and systemic dysregulation of glucose metabolism. However, how BC influences glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Here we show that BC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) suppress pancreatic endocrine secretion to systemically reset glucose homeostasis.

The underlying mechanisms that contribute to disease pathogenesis remain largely unknown, partially accounted by the fact that mouse models with heterozygous deletions in Hnf1b do not develop diabetes, in contrast to the phenotypes observed in MODY patients. Here we used a well-controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell pancreatic differentiation model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying HNF1B-associated diabetes and pancreatic hypoplasia. more... #> 166                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bipolar disorder (BD) and obesity are highly comorbid.

resource for regenerative medicine. Using micro-manipulation and methylcellulose-containing colony/organoid assays, we identified cells within the human cadaveric exocrine pancreas that fulfill the definition of a stem cell: able to self-renew and differentiate. Exocrine tissues were collected after the isolation of endocrine cells, dissociated into single cells, and plated into a 3-dimensional semisolid medium. We found that some pancreatic ductal cells gave rise to cystic colonies/organoids containing pancreatic duct, acinar, and endocrine lineage cells. These cells self-renewed and expanded approximately 300-fold over 9 weeks. When transplanted into diabetic mice, colonies/organoids lowered blood glucose levels and gave rise to insulin-expressing endocrine cells. Thus, stem/progenitor-like cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation either preexist in the adult human pancreas or readily adapt in culture. more... #> 176

Functional studies showed that DRAIR regulates anti-inflammatory genes and its knockdown enhances proinflammatoory phentype of monocytes. To examine mechanisms of DRAIR actions, we performed Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assays using DRAIR biotinylated tiling oligonucleotides to identify chromatin inding sites in THP-1 monocytes. #> 185                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Monocyte activation by high glucose and free fatty acids promotes inflammation implicated in vascular complications associated with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Emerging evidence shows that long non coding RNA (lncRNA)s regulate inflammation, but their  role in  T2D induced monocyte dysfunction is unclear. To examine this, we profiled the transcriptome of CD14+ monocytes from volunteers with T2D and without diabetes (n=5 each) using strand-specific RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500. more... #> 186                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of cord blood cells obtained from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) pregnancies.

To model the transcriptional responses of islet cells to DNA damage, we previously developed a human islet culture model in which the DNA damage response and senescence can be induced via double strand-breaks with the agent bleomycin. Here, we report the transcriptome-wide changes in human pancreatic islet cells following bleomycin exposure. #> 188                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        We investigated  the role of SNO-GNIA2 in HG+oxLDL-induced endothelial inflammation during the development of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis and found that SNO-GNAI2 could promote endothelial inflammation through dysregulating Hippo-YAP .  We hypothesized that SNO-GNAI2 induced Hippo-YAP dysfunction through enhancing coupling and activating  G-protein coupling receptors (GPCRs). #> 189                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We describe an unusual course of Ketosis Prone Diabetes and investigate potential mechanisms using induced pluripotent stem cell technology with high throughput mRNA sequencing and validation of a lecuine sensitive mTOR pathway. #> 190                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established and potent independent risk factor for degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

However, the molecular mechanisms implicated in sarcopenia and changes in muscle proteome associated with SX in elderly men remain unclear. more... #> 196                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The placenta is a highly heterogeneous organ and is closely related to adverse pregnancy. The previous bulk sequencing of whole tissue  could not show the characteristics of individual cells and the interactions between cells. Here, we select the placental tissues of the gestational diabetes group(GDM), preeclampsia group(PE), advanced age group(GL) and normal control group for single-cell sequencing in order to explain the mechanism of related diseases in more depth.nated spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in the murine hindlimb determines the identity of mesenchymal progenitors and the development of diversity of musculoskeletal tissues they form. more... #> 197                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Studies in rodents have shown obesity and aging impair tissue nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis, which contributes to metabolic dysfunction. The availability of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is an important rate-limiting factor in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis.

Here we analyzed mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of 80 human post-mortem retinal samples from 80 patients diagnosed with various stages of DR. more... #> 202                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             By functionally dissecting  densest enhancer cluster in the gene desert at 9P21 locus, we identified a non-redundant inter-dependent enhancer network that functions over long distances, the perturbation in any enhancer in the network results in the complete collapse of entire enhancer cluster and target genes activity. The enhancer network can be targeted to regulate INK4a/ARF locus in associated pathophysiologies and cancers. #> 203                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          To gain insight into the history of islet cell deterioration along the progression from normal glycemic regulation to T2D, we collected surgical pancreatic tissue samples from 133 metabolically phenotyped pancreatectomized patients (PPP).

We have investigated lipolysis and glucose homeostasis in recently diagnosed obese type-2 diabetics; in obese insulin resistant non-diabetic subjects (obese-IR) matched for age, sex, body composition and fasting insulin levels; and in healthy lean individuals. Our results show that obese-IR dissociate lipolysis from glycemic control, revealing that the action of compensatory hyperinsulinemia on blood glucose is not mediated by reduced lipolysis. more... #> 206                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In a randomized controlled trial, 82 older adults (>65y) with (or at risk of) undernutrition (n=82) were randomly allocated to 12 weeks of supplementation with a novel supplement (586 kcal, 22 g protein of which 50% whey and 50% casein, 206 mg ursolic acid, 7 g free BCAAs, 11 µg vitamin D) or standard care (600 kcal, 24g protein of which 100% casein, 4 µg vitamin D).

This limits our understanding of disease-causing regulatory variants. INS promoter mutations cause recessive neonatal diabetes. We studied 60 patients with such mutations, and show that all single base mutations disrupt a CC dinucleotide, while none affect elements important for INS promoter function in episomal assays.

We used microarrays to detail the lncRNAs and mRNAs expression in type 2 diabetes patients and healthy controls and obtained differentially expressed genes. more... #> 213                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Over 90% of disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding variants. Platform to efficiently validate the biological function of variants thus discovered remain distinctly lacking. Here, we used β-like cells derived from isogenic human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), carrying the type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated noncoding SNP rs2542151T>G or the knockout of the SNP-associated gene PTPN2−/−, to systematically examine the role of the T1D associated noncoding variant in β cell function and survival. more... #> 214                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Glucocorticoids are key regulators of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic islet function.

Aging beta-cells acquire markers of cellular senescence and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can lead to senescence and dysfunction of neighboring cells through paracrine actions, contributing to beta-cell failure. Herein, we defined the beta-cell SASP signature based on unbiased proteomic analysis of conditioned media of cells obtained from human senescent beta-cells. more... #> 217                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Genetic risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex disease are primarily non-coding, and translating risk variants into mechanistic insight requires detailed gene regulatory maps in disease-relevant cell types.

This portion of the kidney is responsible for reabsorption of the filtered glucose, and thus, the amount reabsorbed is not regulated by insulin.

The cause of this is unknown. In this study whole islets were extracted with laser capture microdissection from organ donors 1-81 years of age. Increasing age was associated with a downregulation of pathways associated with the cell cycle and increase in markers of senescence e.g. CDKN2A. Among novel genes increasing with age was SPP1. #> 229                                                                                         Aims/hypothesis: Recurrent hypoglycaemia (RH) is a major side-effect of intensive insulin therapy for people with diabetes. Changes in hypoglycaemia sensing by the brain contribute to the development of impaired counterregulatory responses to and awareness of hypoglycaemia. Little is known about the intrinsic changes in human astrocytes in response to acute and recurrent low glucose (RLG) exposure.  Methods: Human primary astrocytes (HPA) were exposed to zero, one, three or four bouts of low glucose (0.1 mmol/l) for three hours per day for four days to mimic RH.  On the fourth day, DNA and RNA were collected. Differential gene expression and ontology analyses were performed using DESeq2 and GOseq respectively. DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform.  Results: 24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected (after correction for multiple comparisons). One bout of low glucose exposure had the largest effect on gene expression. Pathway analyses revealed that endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as HSPA5, XBP1, and MANF, involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), were all significantly increased following LG exposure, which was diminished following RLG. There was little correlation between differentially methylated positions and changes in gene expression yet the number of bouts of LG exposure produced distinct methylation signatures.  Conclusions/interpretation: These data suggest that exposure of human astrocytes to transient LG triggers activation of genes involved in the UPR linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Following RLG, the activation of UPR related genes was diminished, suggesting attenuated ER stress. This may be mediated by metabolic adaptations to better preserve intracellular and/or ER ATP levels, but this requires further investigation. #> 230                                                                                         Aims/hypothesis: Recurrent hypoglycaemia (RH) is a major side-effect of intensive insulin therapy for people with diabetes.

age (SGA) infants are to be at high risk of noncommunicable diseases in adolescence, because they are exposed to hypoxia and malnutrition in and ex utero during perinatal period. Epigenetics could be one of the most important mechanisms of DOHaD.In the field of premature babies, previous studies investigated the methylation alterations related to gestational age and birthweight by using cord blood samples. more... #> 237                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We profiled scRNA-seq of 284 samples collected from 196 individuals, including 22 patients with mild/moderate symptoms, 54 hospitalized patients with severe symptoms, and 95 recovered convalescent persons, as well as 25 healthy controls.

Genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk affect gene regulation in metabolically relevant tissues, such as pancreatic islets. Here, we investigated contributions of regulatory programs active during pancreatic development to T2D risk. Interrogation of chromatin maps from developmental precursors throughout pancreatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) identifies enrichment of T2D variants in pancreatic progenitor-specific stretch enhancers that are not active in islets. more... #> 245                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The increased usage of alternative Ayurvedic treatments as potential health-beneficial therapies emphasizes the importance of studying its efficacy in sound placebo-controlled intervention trials.

In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic changes in cortical neurones, and associated astrocytes and endothelial cells of the neurovascular unit, in the ageing brain #> 251                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It has been well established that the presence of diabetes is accompanied by a chronic inflammatory state promoting various diabetes-associated complications. One potential driver of this enhanced inflammatory state in patients with diabetes is hyperglycemia. Even after blood glucose control is achieved, diabetes-associated complications persist, suggesting the presence of a “hyperglycemic memory.” Innate immune cells, critically involved in various complications associated with diabetes, can build nonspecific, immunological memory (trained immunity) via epigenetic regulation. more... #> 252                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Adipose tissue is found throughout the human body. The diversity of physiological specialization of fat depots is reflected in the depot-specific alterations seen in lipodystrophies and links between specific patterns of fat distribution and susceptibility to diseases, including Type II Diabetes.

However, under pathological conditions such as diabetes, exosome cargo composition changes and harmful miRNAs can be transferred to the recipient cells and induce more deleterious effects in target tissues. more... #> 255                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Improving the early diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) can effectively control blood glucose. To investigate new long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as molecular markers we used microarrays to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from T2D patients and controls. #> 256                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that potentiates glucose  stimulated insulin secretion. GLP-1 is classically produced by gut L cells; however, under  certain circumstances alpha-cells can express the prohormone convertase required for  proglucagon processing to GLP-1, prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), and can produce  GLP-1. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs are poorly defined. more... #> 257                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 258                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The downregulation of diabetes susceptibility gene GLIS3 contributes to pancreatic beta cell demise, at least in part, through downregulation of the  splicing factor SRSF6. Here, we used individual-nucleotide UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP)  to map the RNA binding landscape of SRSF6 in pancreatic beta cells. #> 259                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The gene expression signature of the human kidney interstitium is not fully understood. Transcript expression of laser microdissected cortical interstitium (excluding tubules, glomeruli and large vessels) in 9 human reference nephrectomies was compared to 6 human diabetic kidney biopsy specimens. This transcriptomic data revealed novel interstitial markers and enrichment of relevant pathways. Analysis of diabetic interstitium uncovered genes with unchanged as well as down-regulated expression when compared to reference samples. more... #> 260                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Glycemic control is a strong predictor of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes mellitus, and poor glycemic control influences long-term risk of cardiovascular disease even decades after optimal medical management. This phenomenon, termed glycemic memory, has been proposed to occur due to stable programs of cardiac and endothelial cell gene expression.

Here we demonstrate that estrogen suppletion and insulin resistance in male-to-female transgenders coincides with lower plasma levels of miR-224 and miR-452 carried in extracellular vesicles. Systemic silencing of miR-224 and miR-452 in mice triggered a prediabetic phenotype with higher plasma insulin levels, increased white adipose lipogenesis and less glucose uptake and mitochondrial respiration in brown adipose tissue. more... #> 266                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This study aimed to examine the postprandial transcriptome of adipose tissue middle-aged men selectively recruited on the basis of MetS (defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria) and healthy control participants.

During metabolic stress, adipose tissue is more likely to release free fatty acids (FFA) in the serum resulting in an increase of FFA levels not only in blood, but also in follicular fluid (FF). In humans, high concentrations of palmitic acid (PA) and stearic acid (SA) reduced granulosa cell survival and were associated with poor cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) morphology. more... #> 271                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The aim of this study was therefore to investigate molecular mechanisms associated with insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle by relating global skeletal muscle gene expression with a surrogate measure of insulin sensitivity, i.e. homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

They all have European ancestry and 18 of them have a first-degree family member with T2D. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 37.71 ± 0.71 years and 28.47 ± 0.48 kg/m2, respectively, and the mean 1/the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 0.69 ± 0.04 #> 274                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The mechanisms underlying Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery-induced weight loss and the immediate postoperative beneficial metabolic effects associated with the operation remain uncertain.

To examine the signaling pathways triggered by DG-LRG1, we subjected whole-cell protein lysates of control and DG-LRG1 treated HUVECs to a Phospho Explorer antibody array analysis using commercial antibody array assay kit (Full Moon Biosystems, Inc.). more... #> 281                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Pancreatic β-cell failure is key to type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset and progression. We assessed whether human β-cell dysfunction induced by metabolic stress is reversible, evaluated the molecular pathways underlying persistent or transient damage, and explored the relationships with T2D islet traits. Twenty-six human islet preparations were exposed to several lipo- and/or glucotoxicity conditions, some of which impaired insulin release depending on stressor type, concentration and combination. more... #> 282                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Persons with HIV have a disproportionate burden of metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the accumulation of chronically activated T cells in the adipose tissue of HIV+ persons is a central mechanism promoting local macrophage activation, impaired adipocyte function, and the development of HIV-associated glucose intolerance.

Thus, searching for vulnerabilities of metformin-resistant prostate cancer is a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficiency. A genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 activation library targeting 23430 genes is conducted to identify the genes that confer resistance to metformin in prostate cancer cells. #> 288                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Diabetes mellitus is associated with serious long-term complications, including increased cardiovascular risk and a higher occurrence of infections.

Here we investigate whether metabolism and function of monocytes are changed in patients with diabetes and aim to identify diabetes-associated factors driving these alterations. more... #> 289                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Dedifferentiation of pancreatic beta cells may reduce islet function in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the prevalence, plasticity and functional consequences of this cellular state remain unknown.  We employed single-cell RNAseq to detail the maturation program of alpha and beta cells during human ontogeny. We show that although both alpha and beta cells mature in part by repressing non-endocrine genes, alpha-cells retain hallmarks of an immature state, while beta-cells attain a full beta-cell specific gene expression program. more... #> 290                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In vitro differentiation of human ES cells into insulin-producing β-like cells offers new opportunities for pancreatic development modeling and potential diabetes therapy.

In particular class IIa HDACs have been shown to affect hepatic gluconeogenesis and previous approaches revealed that their inhibition reduces blood glucose in type 2 diabetic mice. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of class IIa HDAC inhibition as a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of metabolic diseases. more... #> 296                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      IL-12 and IL-18 synergize to promote TH1 responses and have been implicated as accelerators of autoimmune pathogenesis in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We therefore investigated the influence of these cytokines on phenotype and function of immune cells that are involved in disease progression. To understand how IL-12 and IL-18 may synergize to impair Treg function and phenotype, we conducted transcriptional profiling of Treg expanded under normal conditions or in the presence of IL-12 and IL-18. more... #> 297                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         We identified that PBMC of individuals simultaneously affected by a combination of T2DM, dyslipidemia and periodontitis, showed altered molecular profile mainly associated to inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, and infectious disease pathways Patients were divided into: T2DMpoorly-DL-P (n=5, Grupo 1), T2DMwell-DL-P (n=7, Grupo 2), DL-P (n=6, Grupo 3), P (n=6, Grupo 4) and Healthy (n=6, Control). more... #> 298                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The growth hormone plays a significant role in normal renal function and overactive growth hormone signaling has been implicated in proteinuria in diabetes. Earlier studies from our group have shown that the glomerular podocytes, which play an essential role in renal filtration, express the growth hormone receptor, suggesting the direct action of growth hormone on these cells. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism and the downstream pathways that are induced by the excess growth hormone in these podocytes leading to diabetic nephropathy are not clearly established. more... #> 299                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The incidence of new onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) has increased over the past decade, likely due to calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus (TAC) and cyclosporin (CsA). Voclosporin (VCS), a next generation calcineurin inhibitor is reported to cause fewer incidences of NODAT but the reason is unclear. Whilst calcineurin signaling plays important roles in pancreatic beta-cell survival, proliferation, and function, its effects on human beta-cells remain understudied. more... #> 300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 301                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We perfomed transcriptomic and methylomic analysis of sural nerve biopsies from type 2 diabetic patients with neuropathy.

In vitro exposure of β-cells to the saturated free fatty acid palmitate is a valuable model of lipotoxicity, reproducing features of β-cell failure observed in type 2 diabetes. In order to map the β-cell response to lipotoxicity, we combined RNA-sequencing of palmitate-treated human islets with iTRAQ proteomics of insulin-secreting INS-1E cells following a time course exposure to palmitate. more... #> 315                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Circulating cell-free unmethylated DNA fragments arising from the human INS gene have been proposed as biomarkers of β-cell death for the presymptomatic detection of diabetes. However, given the variability of CpG methylation in the INS gene in different cell types, this gene alone may not yield sufficiently specific information to unambiguously report β-cell damage. We employed an unbiased approach using data from a human DNA methylation gene array to identify the CHTOP gene as a candidate biomarker whose CpGs show a greater frequency of unmethylation in human islets. more... #> 316                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy (DR), coupling with irregular neovascularization, and is the leading cause of blindness in working-age people; but the molecular mechanism of vascular differentiation in PDR remains poorly characterized.

However, lncRNA regulation of mitochondrial fission in podocytes is poorly understood. Here, we want to identify how lncRNA changes in human podocytes cultured with high glucose. #> 324                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of functional islet beta cell mass, deficiency of glucose-lowering insulin, and persistent alpha cell secretion of gluconeogenic glucagon. Still, no therapies that target these underlying processes are available. We therefore performed high-throughput screening of 300,000 compounds and extensive medicinal chemistry optimization and here report the discovery of SRI-37330, an orally bioavailable, non-toxic small molecule, which effectively rescued mice from streptozotocin- and obesity-induced (db/db) diabetes. more... #> 325                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Interest in human brown fat as a novel therapeutic target to tackle the growing obesity and diabetes epidemic has increased dramatically in recent years.

We experienced a rare case with chronic hepatitis C, in which multiple liver tumors at different stages in multistep hepatocarcinogenesis were observed at the same time. Under the same genetic and etiological backgrounds, comparisons of expression profiles among dysplastic nodules (DN), well differentiated HCC (WEL), and moderately differentiated HCC (MOD) would provide critical genetic information for the initiation and progression of HCC. #> 327                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The aim of this study was to conduct a baseline comparison of serum-circulating miRNA in prediabetic individuals with the distinction between those who later progressed to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and those who did not. The expression level of 798 miRNAs using NanoString technology was examined. Spearman correlation, ROC curve analysis, and logistic regression modeling were performed. Gene ontology (GO), canonical pathways analysis were used to explore the biological functions of the miRNA target genes. more... #> 328                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Four miRNAs showed significantly different expression post-vitamin C supplementation including the down-regulation of miR-451a, and up-regulation of miR-1253, miR-1290 and miR-644a.

Despite its wide application in the treatment of multiple health conditions, the glycemic response to metformin is highly variable, emphasizing the need for reliable biomarkers.   We chose the RNA-Seq-based comparative transcriptomics approach to evaluate the systemic effect of metformin and highlight potential predictive biomarkers of metformin response in drug-naïve type 2 diabetes patient volunteers in vivo. more... #> 333                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Purpose: The goal of this study is to characterize the gene expression profiles and identify genes of interest (GOI) in stenotic (AS) and regurgitant (AI) human aortic valves using RNA sequencing technology.

characterisation of CD4+ T cells at the single-cell level has been performed by two largely exclusive types of technologies: single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and antibody-based cytometry. Here we present a multi-omics approach allowing the simultaneous targeted quantification of mRNA and protein expression in single-cells and investigate its performance to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations. more... #> 339                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Obesity is a major public health burden worldwide, greatly increasing the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Obesity and associated insulin resistance are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation driven by the cooperation of the innate immune system and dysregulated metabolism in adipose tissue and other metabolic organs. RIPK1 (Receptor-Interacting serine/threonine Protein Kinase 1) is a central regulator of inflammatory cell function that coordinates inflammation, apoptosis and necroptosis in response to inflammatory stimuli. more... #> 340                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We collected the mid-morning urine samples, and centrifuged at 2000g for ten minutes in order to remove cells and debris, and then stored in -80 degree refrigerator. we selected 2 samples per group for the microRNA arrays in the following four groups: normal control, IGT with renal impairment, diabetes, diabetic kidney disease.

LINC00473 is detected in progenitor cells, and increases upon differentiation and in response to cAMP. more... #> 355                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cigarette smoking is one of the largest causes of preventable death worldwide. Smoking behaviors, including age at smoking initiation (ASI), smoking dependence (SD), and smoking cessation (SC), are all complex phenotypes determined by both genetic and environmental factors as well as their interactions. To identify susceptibility loci for each smoking phenotype, numerous studies have been conducted, with approaches including genome-wide linkage scans, candidate gene-based association analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS). more... #> 356                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Proinflammatory cytokines are important mediators of pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and demise in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We presently characterized human beta cell responses to IFNa by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial beta cell response to IFNa was characterized by major chromatin remodeling, followed by marked changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFNa-induced changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage increased the diversity of transcripts expressed by beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may significantly expand the peptide repertoire presented by beta cells to the immune system. On the other hand, beta cells up-regulated checkpoint proteins, such as PDL1 and HLA-E, that may protect them against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis led to the identification of two compound classes that revert IFNa effects on human beta cells and may be translated to clinical trials. #> 357                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Proinflammatory cytokines are important mediators of pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and demise in type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Data from  human genetic studies have shown that Grb14 functions as a negative modulator of IR  activity, and germline Grb14-knockout (KO) mice have improved insulin signaling in liver  and muscle tissues. more... #> 360                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cigarette smoking is one of the largest causes of preventable death worldwide. Smoking behaviors, including age at smoking initiation (ASI), smoking dependence (SD), and smoking cessation (SC), are all complex phenotypes determined by both genetic and environmental factors as well as their interactions. To identify susceptibility loci for each smoking phenotype, numerous studies have been conducted, with approaches including genome-wide linkage scans, candidate gene-based association analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS). more... #> 361                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 362                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The pool of beta cell-specific CD8+ T-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D) sustains an autoreactive potential despite having access to a constant source of antigen.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-B signaling in endothelial cells promotes uptake and transcytosis of fatty acids (FA) from the bloodstream to the underlying tissue, advancing pathological lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in diabetic complications. Here we demonstrate a VEGF-B dependent obstruction of endothelial glucose transport attributed to plasma membrane lipid alterations affecting glucose transporter 1 function, which was independent of FA uptake. more... #> 365                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified a chromosome 8 locus associated with fasting glucose (FG), insulin (FI) and lipid levels that is located near PPP1R3B (a gene which encodes the catalytic subunit of a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that promotes hepatic glycogen storage upon insulin signaling).

Much of our knowledge relating to human Beta-cell development and function has depended on rodent models, which have provided a blueprint to confirm important cellular features in humans. The advent of next generation sequencing studies, however, has highlighted discrepancies in Beta-cells which exist between mice and men. The precise contribution of such differences has not yet been fully appreciated. more... #> 372                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC’s) constitute a vital population of multipotent cells capable of differentiating into end-organ tissues. However, scientific endeavors to harness the regenerative potential of ASC’s for regenerative medicine are currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that determine cell-lineage commitment and stemness. In the current study, we used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis to identify epigenetic gene targets and cellular processes that are responsive to 5-azathioprine, a potent inducer of DNA methylation. more... #> 373                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The generation of pancreatic cell types from renewable cell sources holds promise for cell replacement therapies for diabetes. Although most effort has focused on generating pancreatic beta cells, there is considerable evidence that glucagon secreting alpha cells are critically involved in disease progression and proper glucose control.

We determined differential response in gene expression to high glucose in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from matched type 1 diabetic individuals with and without retinopathy. Those genes exhibiting the largest difference in glucose response between diabetic subjects with and without retinopathy were assessed for association to diabetic retinopathy utilizing genotype data from a meta-genome-wide association study. more... #> 375                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DNA methylation may be involved in development of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but previous epigenome-wide association studies were conducted among cases with clinically diagnosed diabetes.

Conversely, establishing limitations in proliferative potential may be important to achieve functional maturity as well as to prevent abnormal growths after transplantation of stem cell derived products. Here we induced exit from the cell cycle in pancreatic progenitors by interfering with the progression of DNA replication and determined growth potential, differentiation and maturation to insulin producing endocrine cells. more... #> 377                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Early-onset complex autoimmunity can arise from monogenic activating mutations in inflammatory signalling pathways or loss of function mutations of immunoregulatory molecules.

Here we combined the generation of single cell derived clonal cultures from human adult kidney with transcriptomic analysis for molecular characterization of in-vitro clonal behavior at inception and after propagation. We discovered two types of clones; rapidly proliferating de-differentiated fibroblast-like (FL) originating from the proximal tubule and stably proliferating cuboidal epithelial-like (EL) originating from distal segments that efficiently propagate with one cell giving rise to 3.3*10(6) cells. more... #> 380                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Maternal obesity impacts the health of offspring, increasing the risk of developing obesity and/or other metabolic dysregulation in childhood or later in life.

Peripheral blood samples were collected in tempus tubes from a healthy control subject with no family history of autoimmunity (n=1) and from subjects with Type 1 diabetes (n=4). Total RNA was isolated independently from 3 replicate aliquots of the same tempus samples and then globin-reduced. RNAseq libraries were prepared from the globin-reduced RNA. #> 384  BACKGROUND: Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D), such as macrovascular and microvascular events, are the major causes for T2D-related disability and mortality. A clinically convenient, non-invasive approach for monitoring the development of these complications would improve the overall life quality of patients with T2D and help reduce healthcare burden through preventive interventions.  METHODS: A selective chemical labeling strategy for 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC-Seal) was used to profile genome-wide 5hmCs, an emerging class of epigenetic markers implicated in complex diseases including diabetes, in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from a collection of Chinese patients (n = 62). Differentially modified 5hmC markers between patients with T2D with and without macrovascular/microvascular complications were analyzed under a case-control design.  RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in 5hmC markers were associated with T2D-related macrovascular/microvascular complications, involving genes and pathways relevant to vascular biology and diabetes, including insulin resistance and inflammation. A 16-gene 5hmC marker panel accurately distinguished patients with vascular complications from those without (testing set: AUC = 0.85, 95%CI, 0.73-0.96), outperforming conventional clinical variables such as urinary albumin. In addition, a separate 13-gene 5hmC marker panel could distinguish patients with single complications from those with multiple complications (testing set: AUC = 0.84, 95%CI, 0.68-0.99), showing superiority over conventional clinical variables.  CONCLUSIONS: The 5hmC markers in cfDNA reflected the epigenetic changes in patients with T2D who developed macrovascular/microvascular complications. The 5hmC-Seal assay has the potential to be a clinically convenient, non-invasive approach that can be applied in the clinic to monitor the presence and severity of diabetic vascular complications. #> 385                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We investigated genome wide changes in gene expression in skin between patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic patients using next generation sequencing.

The \"matured\" and \"failed\" subgroups were similar in terms of demographics (age range, sex distribution, ethnicity distribution), clinical characteristics (proportion of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, previous hemodialysis access history), and time interval between first-stage and second-stage surgeries. more... #> 387                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Severe angiopathy has been postulated as a major driver for diabetes associated secondary complications.

The common endpoint for all ex vivo strategies is transplantation into diabetic patients. However, the effects of hyperglycemia environment on the transplanted cells were not yet properly assessed. Thus, the main goal of this study was to characterize global effect of brief and prolonged in vivo hyperglycemia exposure on the cell fate acquisition and maintenance of transplanted human pancreatic progenitors. more... #> 390                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    DPN muscle exhibits features of degeneration with attempted regeneration.  In the most severely pathological muscle samples, regeneration appears to be stymied and our data suggest that this may be partly due to intrinsic dysfunction of the satellite cell pool in addition to extrinsic structural pathology (e.g. nerve damage). #> 391                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Obesity, and visceral adiposity in particular, increases the risk of common metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several forms of cancer.

The aim of this study was to determine  the circulating lncRNA profile and confirmed the differentially expressed lncRNA between T1D patients and healthy control. #> 401                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Progressive loss of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) is associated with the onset of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Transplantation of NPCs, derived from human pluripotent stem cells including hESC/iPSCs, may offer a novel therapy for IDD. To date, effective in vitro differentiations of notochordal and NP cells remained to be demonstrated. Towards this end, we developed a three-step protocol to directly differentiate hESC/iPSC towards mesodermal, then notochordal and finally NPCs. more... #> 402                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Transient Pax8 expression was reported in mouse islets during gestation, whereas a genome-wide linkage and admixture mapping study highlighted PAX8 as a candidate gene for diabetes mellitus (DM). We sought the significance of PAX8 expression in mouse and human islet biology. PAX8 was induced in gestating mouse islets and in human islets treated with recombinant prolactin.

Here we report that an unexpectedly high fraction of lncRNAs, but not protein-coding mRNAs, is repressed during diet-induced obesity (DIO) and refeeding, whilst nutrient deprivation specifically induced lncRNAs in mouse liver. Similarly, lncRNAs were lost in diabetic humans. more... #> 407                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    To identify the factors mediating the progression of di- abetic nephropathy (DN), we performed RNA sequencing of kidney biopsy samples from patients with early DN, advanced DN, and normal kidney tissue from nephrectomy samples.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in T cells that can promote aberrant activation thereby triggering autoimmune progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that during early stages of islet autoimmunity a miRNA142-3p/Tet2 signaling axis in murine and human CD4+T cells interferes with the efficient induction of regulatory T (Treg) cells accompanied by impairments in Treg stability. more... #> 417                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Insulin resistance (IR) is likely to induce metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in T cells that can promote aberrant activation thereby triggering autoimmune progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that during early stages of islet autoimmunity a miRNA142-3p/Tet2 signaling axis in murine and human CD4+T cells interferes with the efficient induction of regulatory T (Treg) cells accompanied by impairments in Treg stability. more... #> 420                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that have the ability to drive cell lineage decisions by regulating the expression of hundreds of genes.

Currently, it is unclear whether advanced donor age and commonly associated comorbidities affect the properties of ex vivo-expanded BMSCs. Thus, we stratified cells from adult and elderly donors from our biobank (n = 10 and n = 13, mean age 38 and 72 years, respectively) and compared their phenotypic and functional performance, using multiple assays typically employed as minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).We found that BMSCs from both cohorts meet the standard criteria for MSC, exhibiting similar morphology, growth kinetics, gene expression profiles, and pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive potential and the capacity to differentiate toward adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages.We found no substantial differences between cells from the adult and elderly cohorts. more... #> 427                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      β-cell specific IFT88 knock-out mice recapitulate human diabetes with impaired insulin secretion and altered islet hormone paracrine regulation.

T1D subjects were recently shown to harbor distinct intestinal microbiome profiles. Based on these findings, the role of gut bacteria in T1D is being intensively investigated. The mechanism connecting intestinal microbial homeostasis with the development of T1D is unknown.  Specific gut bacteria such as Bacteroides dorei (BD) and Ruminococcus gnavus (RG) show markedly increased abundance prior to the development of autoimmunity. more... #> 430                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A slower transmethylation of one-carbon substrates in the edematous form of severe acute malnutrition (ESAM) suggests that downstream aberrations in DNA methylation could drive differences in acute pathogenesis between ESAM and non-edematous malnutrition (NESAM). Here, we integrate genome-wide assessments of DNA methylation with corresponding gene expression profiles and sequence variation to show that relative to NESAM, acute ESAM is characterized by significant hypomethylation at 99% of differentially methylated loci in two SAM cohorts, whereas recovered adults show no significant differences in methylation. more... #> 431                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Analysis of monogenic kidney disease-causing genes, and secondary pathology resulting from systemic diseases including diabetes and hypertension, highlight the importance of the kidney’s filtering system, the renal corpuscles.

Appropriate depth is critical. Shallow invasion increases the risk of pregnancy complications, e.g., severe preeclampsia. Overly deep invasion, the hallmark of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), increases the risk of pre-term delivery, hemorrhage and death. more... #> 436                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Fishoil or n-3 PUFA supplementation has shown some beneficial effects in patients with NASH.

Normoandrogen (NA) and Hyperandrogen (HA) PCOS are distinguished under distinct level of testosterone, while markers and expression patterns for both subtypes were not adequately studied. Text-mining analysis stated the correlation for PCOS with granusola cells and thus we performed microarray analysis on granusola cells from HA PCOS, NA PCOS and normal tissue from individuals, and afterwards downloaded RNA-seq and microarray data from NCBI GEO database on granusola cells from PCOS and normal ovary. more... #> 444                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Background: Macrophage-based immune dysregulation plays a critical role in development of delayed gastric emptying in animal models of diabetes. Human studies have also revealed loss of anti-inflammatory macrophages and increased expression of genes associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages in full thickness gastric biopsies from gastroparesis patients.

Epidemiological and experimental works support the link between type 2 diabetes and breast cancer; these data support that insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated levels of IGF-1 in patients with type II diabetes mellitus promote growth and invasiveness of tumor cells. more... #> 450                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Here we investigated the degree by which epigenetic signatures in children from mothers with obesity or gestational diabetes mellitus are influenced by environmental factors.   We profiled the DNA methylation signature of whole blood from lean, obese and gestational diabetes mellitus mothers and their respective newborns.  DNA methylation profiles of mothers showed high similarity across groups, while on the contrary, newborns from GDM mothers showed a marked distinct epigenetic profile compared to newborns of both lean and obese mothers. more... #> 451                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is a chronic complication of diabetes and the primary cause of end stage renal disease. DN can be differentially diagnosed only through histological investigation. Therefore, there is need for molecular biomarkers, such as miRNAs, to discriminate among different histological lesions in diabetics. Aim of this study was to identify a pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs in kidney biopsies of DN patients and to assess their potential as differential diagnostic biomarkers. more... #> 452                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Stem cell-derived β (SC-β) cells are an emerging regenerative therapy to compensate for loss of functional β cell mass in diabetes.

For this purpose, a microarray was performed to study the gene expression profile of macrophages cultivated in a high glucose concentration. more... #> 458                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Phenotypic flexibility is used as a measure for health and can be studied during nutritional challenge tests. Changes in gene expression are early markers and give insight into mechanisms. Energy restriction (ER) has a variety of beneficial health effects and can be used to investigate different health states to study postprandial changes during challenge tests.

We resolve populations corresponding to beta cells, alpha-like poly-hormonal cells, non-endocrine cells that resemble pancreatic exocrine cells and a previously unreported population resembling enterochromaffin cells. more... #> 470                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) provide the reservoir of regenerative cells to produce new adipocytes, although their identity in humans remains elusive. Using FACS analysis, gene expression profiling and metabolic and proteomic analyses, we identified three APCs subtypes in human white adipose tissues. The APC subtypes are molecularly distinct but possess similar proliferative and adipogenic capacities. more... #> 471                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is a study of 114 newborns aimed at identifying associations of cord blood methylation profiles with measures of newborn adiposity.

Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of innate T cells, which we have previously reported are dysregulated in obesity, with altered circulating and adipose tissue frequencies and a reduction in their IFN-gamma production, which is a critical effector function of MAIT cells in host defence. more... #> 473                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Using influenza infection as a disease model, we used a systems biology approach to analyse host response and to identify immune pathways that might contribute to disease progression. We recruited influenza patients with varying severity of infection (n=154) and collected peripheral blood samples within 24 hours of their presentation to hospitals. Gene-expression arrays of these samples were analysed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis to detect disease-driving modules. more... #> 474                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b) is a lipid raft enzyme that regulates plasma membrane (PM) fluidity. Here we report that SMPDL3b excess, as observed in podocytes in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), impairs insulin receptor isoform B-dependent pro-survival insulin signaling by interfering with insulin receptor isoforms binding to caveolin-1 in PM. SMPDL3b excess affects the production of active sphingolipids resulting in decreased ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) content as observed in human podocytes in vitro and in kidney cortexes of diabetic db/db mice in vivo. more... #> 475                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3, the second most frequent form of diabetes caused by single gene mutation. We generated human pancreatic stem cell-derived endocrine cells with mutations in HNF1A and show that HNF1A deficiency impairs scβ-cell fate, insulin granule maturation and the secretion of insulin in a glucose responsive manner.

Despite the epidemiological importance of WAT there is a paucity of translational models to study long term changes in mature adipocytes. Here, we describe a novel method for the culture of mature white adipocytes under a permeable membrane. Compared to existing culture methods such as adipose tissue explants and adipocyte ceiling culture, Membrane mature Adipocyte Aggregate Cultures (MAAC) are superior at maintaining adipogenic gene expression through 2 weeks of culture, do not dedifferentiate, and are under reduced hypoxic stress relative to adipose tissue explants. more... #> 480                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Despite substantial declines in mortality following myocardial infarction (MI), subsequent left ventricular remodelling (LVRm) remains a significant long-term complication. Extracellular small non-coding RNAs (exRNAs) have been associated with cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and we hypothesized that they are associated with post-MI LVRm phenotypes. RNA sequencing of exRNAs was performed on plasma samples from patients with “beneficial” (decrease LVESVI ≥20%, n=11) and “adverse” (increase LVESVI ≥15%, n=11) LVRm. more... #> 481                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 482                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We generated expression profiles of TH1 and TREG cells from T1D and healthy subjects by RNA-Seq.

By integrating enhancers predicted using these ChIP-Seq data, T1D associated SNPs and additional supporting data, we found and validated several novel risk SNPs for T1D. #> 484                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                We conducted a genome-wide placental transcriptome study aiming at the identification of functional pathways representing the molecular link between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and fetal growth. We used RNA microarray (Agilent 8 X 60 K), medical records, and questionnaire data from 183 mother-newborn pairs from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort study (Flanders, Belgium). We applied a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified genes modules and hub genes that were associated with maternal BMI as well as newborn birth weight. more... #> 485                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3, the second most frequent form of diabetes caused by single gene mutation. We generated human pancreatic stem cell-derived endocrine cells with mutations in HNF1A and show that HNF1A deficiency impairs scβ-cell fate, insulin granule maturation and the secretion of insulin in a glucose responsive manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that HNF1A orchestrates a network of genes involved in glucose metabolism, zinc transport, calcium ion binding and hormone exocytosis. more... #> 486                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 487                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells. Mounting evidence supports a central role for β-cell alterations in triggering the activation of self-reactive T-cells in T1D. However, the early deleterious events that occur in β cells, underpinning islet autoimmunity are not known. We hypothesized that epigenetic modifications induced in β cells by inflammatory mediators play a key role in initiating the autoimmune response. more... #> 488                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells.

To gain functional understanding of AMD genetics, we generated transcriptional profiles of retina from 453 individuals including both controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD.  We integrated retinal transcriptomes, covering 13,662 protein-coding and 1,462 noncoding genes, with genotypes at over 9 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of a tissue not included in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and other large datasets. more... #> 497                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Prenatal development is a critical period for programming of neurological disease. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication involving oxidative stress in the placenta, has been associated with long-term health implications for the child, including an increased risk of developing schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders in later life. We have shown previously, in a rodent model of placental oxidative stress, that culture medium conditioned by the placenta alters neuronal characteristics when applied to primary cortical cultures in vitro and mimics many of the neurodevelopmental changes observed in the offspring brain. more... #> 498                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 OBJECTIVE Diet intervention in obese adults is the first strategy to induce weight loss and to improve insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that improvements in insulin sensitivity after weight loss from a short-term dietary intervention tracks with alterations in expression of metabolic genes and abundance of specific lipid species.

However, the effect of metformin on gene expression in endothelial cells remains unknown. We used RNA-seq to profile gene expression in primary human aortic endothelial cells stimulated with metformin in normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic conditions.

Although the mechanisms underlying the fetal origin of metabolic disease are poorly understood, evidence suggests epigenomic alterations play a critical role. We sought to identify changes in DNA methylation patterns that define IUGR in CD3+ T-cells purified from umbilical cord blood obtained from appropriate for gestational age (Control) and IUGR male newborns using a genome-wide assay. more... #> 501                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Animal studies have linked disturbed adipose tissue clock gene rhythms to the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome.

Here, using human adipose stem cell-derived adipocytes, we demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were enriched at sites of patient-specific PPARg binding, which correlated with the individual-specific effects of TZD rosiglitazone (rosi) on gene expression. more... #> 505                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs representing an important class of gene expression modulators.

Comprehensive knowledge of its molecular landscape is lacking, yet required, for effective use of this model. Here, we report chromosomal (spectral karyotyping), genetic (genotyping), epigenomic (ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq), chromatin interaction (Hi-C and Pol2 ChIA-PET), and transcriptomic (RNA-seq and miRNA-seq) maps of EndoC-βH1. more... #> 507                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Identification of filamin-A as a target for insulin and IGF1 action. Insulin analogues have been developed to achieve further improvement in the therapy of diabetes. However, modifications introduced into the insulin molecule might enhance their affinity to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R). Most tumors, including endometrial cancers, express high levels of IGF1R. The present study was aimed at identifying the entire set of genes that are differentially activated by insulin glargine or detemir, in comparison to regular insulin and IGF1, in Type 1 and Type 2 endometrial cancer cell lines (ECC-1 and USPC-1, respectively). more... #> 508                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We report that the effect of GDM on gene expression differs between feto-placental endothelial cells of male vs female progeny, i.e. after pregnancy with a male or female offspring. #> 509                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.

In addition, it is well-known that maternal obesity (MO) increases risk of offspring cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and obesity. However, the mechanisms by which the MO intrauterine environment predisposes offspring to CVD and metabolic dysregulation are unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of MO on primate fetal liver and identify underlying molecular mechanisms by which MO increases disease risk. more... #> 515                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Accumulation of visceral fat around internal organs, is a strong risk predictor for cardiometabolic disease. Although fat deposition at distinct anatomical sites is influenced by genetic factors their functional mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show ENPP6 as a neural determinant of selectively visceral adiposity. Through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body composition analysis in 1,301 individuals from the isolated population of Orkney, we identified low-frequency variants at 4q35.1 associated with a reduction of DXA fat distribution (rs144607341/rs17583822, P = 2.7 x 10-10/ 2.0 x 10-9). more... #> 516                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential unlimited source of insulin-producing β-cells for diabetes treatment. A greater understanding of how β-cells form during embryonic development will improve current hESC differentiation protocols. As β-cells are formed from NEUROG3-expressing endocrine progenitors, this study focused on characterizing the single-cell transcriptomes of mouse and hESC-derived endocrine progenitors. more... #> 517                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Natural and stable cell identity switches, where terminally-differentiated cells convert into different cell-types when stressed, represent a widespread regenerative strategy in animals, yet they are poorly documented in mammals.

Among the potential alternatives, the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESc) into insulin-producing β-cells has taken an early lead. However, while the proportion of β-cells obtained through current methods is relatively high, a significant percentage of undefined non-endocrine cell types are still generated. more... #> 519                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Natural and stable cell identity switches, where terminally-differentiated cells convert into different cell-types when stressed, represent a widespread regenerative strategy in animals, yet they are poorly documented in mammals.

Here we present evidence from miRNA microarray analyses of clinical data sets along with in vitro and in vivo experiments that miR-141 is a key regulator of IDD. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show that miR-141 drives IDD by inducing nucleus pulposus (NP) apoptosis. more... #> 521                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Peripheral blood samples were collected from subjects enrolled in the TrialNet study TN-05. This was a phase II study of the effects of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in new-onset T1D. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood samples and then globin-reduced. RNAseq libraries were prepared from the globin-reduced RNA. #> 522                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Background: Imprinted genes are defined by their preferential expression from one of the two parental alleles. This unique mode of gene expression is dependent on allele-specific DNA methylation profiles established at regulatory sequences called imprinting control regions. These loci are frequently used as biosensors to study how environmental exposures affect methylation and transcription. However, a critical unanswered question is whether they are more, less or equally sensitive to environmental stressors as the rest of the genome. more... #> 523                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Insulin gene mutations are a leading cause of neonatal diabetes. They can lead to proinsulin misfolding and its retention in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This results in increased ER-stress suggested to trigger beta-cell apoptosis. In humans, the mechanisms underlying beta-cell failure remain unclear. Here we show that misfolded proinsulin impairs developing beta-cell proliferation without increasing apoptosis. more... #> 524

multiple aging-associated diseases. While senescent cells often manifest an array of senescence-associated phenotypes, such as cell cycle arrest, altered heterochromatin architecture, reprogrammed metabolism and senescence-associated secretory phenotype(SASP), the identification of senescence cells has been hindered by lack of specific and universal biomarkers. more... #> 527                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Diabetes is prevalent worldwide and associated with severe health complications, including blood vessel damage that leads to cardiovascular disease and death.

Recent studies in mouse models and in cell culture suggest that EVs may modulate insulin signaling. more... #> 531                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The common gamma chain (γc) is required for productive signaling by interleukin (IL)-15, IL-21 and IL-2, which are critically involved in immune activation and regulation. IL-21 and IL-15 are implicated in the pathogenesis of type-1 diabetes, graft-versus-host disease, and celiac disease (CeD), a gluten-mediated autoimmune-like enteropathy. Attempts to treat type-1 diabetes and graft-versus-host disease with biologics targeting one particular cytokine have failed. more... #> 532                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Using an integrated approach to characterize the pancreatic tissue and isolated islets from a 33-year-old with 17 years of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we found donor islets contained β cells without insulitis and lacked glucose-stimulated insulin secretion despite a normal insulin response to cAMP-evoked stimulation. With these unexpected findings for T1D, we sequenced the donor DNA and found a pathogenic heterozygous variant in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A). more... #> 533                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Pancreatic endocrine cells orchestrate the precise control of blood glucose levels, but the contribution of each cell type to diabetes or obesity remains elusive. Here we used a massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq technology (Drop-Seq) to analyze the transcriptome of 26,677 pancreatic islets cells from both healthy and type II diabetic (T2D) donors.

Here we introduce a biomarker – ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-3 (NTPDase3) – that is expressed on the cell surface of essentially all adult human β-cells, including those from individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D). NTPDase3 is expressed dynamically during postnatal human pancreas development, appearing first in acinar cells at birth, but several months later its expression declines in acinar cells while concurrently emerges in islet β-cells. more... #> 535                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Background: Long-term exposure to elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) is deleterious for beta-cell function and may contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Whereas mechanisms of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in FFA-treated beta-cells have been intensively studied, biological events preceding the secretory failure, when GSIS is accentuated, are poorly investigated. more... #> 536                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The aim of this study was to understand if gene expression in atherosclerotic plaque macrophages is altered by diabetes. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to specifically isolate macrophage enriched regions from human carotid atherosclerotic plaque samples. RNA isolated was then sent for sequencing using the Illumina bead array system. Gene expression data revealed that 106 genes from diabetic macrophages are differentially expressed (FDR<0.2) and provide mechanistic evidence for the involvement of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in the development of diabetic atherosclerosis. #> 537                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Circadian misalignment, such as in shift work, has been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, however, direct effects of circadian misalignment on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and muscle molecular circadian clock have never been investigated in humans.

JCAD has been identified as a novel component of endothelial cell-cell junctions (Akashi et al., 2011, BBRC) and regulates angiogenesis (Hara et al, ATVB, 2017). In our study, we observed that JCAD is a 148-KDa protein identified by mass spectrometry, but display a band shift to around 180-200 KDa, suggesting that JCAD is subject to multiple post-translatinonal modification. more... #> 539                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Human CD8+ T cells are the final mediators of autoimmune β-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes. However, their target epitopes have not been demonstrated to be naturally processed and presented by β cells. We therefore performed an epitope discovery study combining HLA Class I peptidomics and transcriptomics strategies. Inflammatory cytokines increased β-cell peptide presentation in vitro, paralleling upregulation of HLA Class I expression. more... #> 540                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We performed genome-wide methylation analysis of primary feto-placental arterial and venous endothelial cells from healthy (AEC and VEC) and GDM complicated pregnancies (dAEC and dVEC).

Of concern, therapeutic interventions shown to significantly dampen or even reverse disease in mouse models have not successfully translated into interventions in human T1D. The present study addresses this disconnect in research translation by directly analyzing human donor islets from individuals with T1D, aiming to provide insight into disease mechanisms and identify potential target pathways for therapeutic intervention. more... #> 545                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            New measures are needed to predict type 1 diabetes disease trajectory.

Here we report a refined gene ontology-based inflammatory index (I.I.359) that is based upon expression levels of 359 transcripts identified in cross-sectional studies of new onset Type 1 diabetes patients and controls, where higher scores reflect greater inflammatory bias. more... #> 546                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 547                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Diabetes is a complex metabolic syndrome characterized by prolonged high blood glucose levels. It is known that diabetes is associated with an elevated risk of cancer, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In particular, it remains unclear as to how hyperglycemia may affect epigenetic checkpoints and tumor suppressor pathways, thus enabling oncogenic transformation. Here we show that long-term hyperglycemic conditions adversely impact the anti-tumor epigenetic mark DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through direct regulation of the tumor suppressor and DNA 5mC hydroxymethylase, TET2. more... #> 548                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Role of circRNAs in active tuberculosis (TB) remains unknown.

We futhermore observe a small increase in enhancer activity for this variant under stimulatory conditions using a luciferase assay. more... #> 550                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is a temporal window from the time diabetes is diagnosed to the appearance of overt kidney disease during which time the disease progresses quietly without detection.  Currently, there is no way to detect early diabetic nephropathy (EDN). Here we performed an unbiased assessment of gene-expression analysis of postmortem human kidneys using microarrays to identify candidate genes that may contribute to EDN. #> 551

first time a high-content environmental chemicals screen using pancreatic β-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and discovered that a commonly used pesticide, propargite, induces pancreatic β-cell DNA damage and necrosis. More interestingly, we found out the genetic background of β-like cells affects their response to propargite-induced toxicity, based on isogenic hPSC platform, including for variants GWAS identified associated with T1D, since isogenic GSTT1-/- and PTPN2-/- pancreatic β-like cells are hypersensitive to propargite-induced β-cell death both in vitro and in vivo. more... #> 554                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This paper describes the first time a high-content environmental chemicals screen using pancreatic β-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and discovered that a commonly used pesticide, propargite, induces pancreatic β-cell DNA damage and necrosis.

These samples were generated with MAD-DASH, a method we developed employing CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein targeting specific overabundant sequences such as adapter dimer or miRNAs to reduce these sequences from final libraries. We sequenced treated and untreated samples to demonstrate specificity, efficacy, and reproducibility of our MAD-DASH small-RNA sequencing protocol. #> 556                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      TaqMan®Array  Human  MicroRNA  Cards  were used to profile the differential expression of human microRNAs in patients with CKD versus heathy controls #> 557                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In the past few decades, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has sharply increased in children and adolescents. Childhood obesity life are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, sleep disturbances and certain cancers in adulthood.

Cocoa contains a complex mixture of flavan-3-ols. Epicatechin, a major monomeric flavan-3-ol, is considered to contribute to the cardio-protective effects of cocoa. We investigated effects of pure epicatechin supplementation on whole genome gene expression profiles of circulating immune cells. more... #> 564                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           We investigate whether lower weight gain with insulin detemir is due to a decrease in energy intake or an increase in energy output and whether any change in energy balance is accompanied by changes in hormones, lipid metabolism and muscle gene expression. #> 565                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The goal of this study was to analyse the effect of a 12 weeks treatment with rosiglitazone on insulin sensitivity in the muscle of type 2 diabetic patients.

Here we assessed the role of subcutaneous adipocyte lipid mobilization (lipolysis) in spontaneous long-term (>10 years) body weight changes. In two independent clinical cohorts we found that low stimulated lipolysis at baseline correlated inversely with body mass index changes over time. Disturbed lipolysis gave odds ratios of ≥4.6 for weight gain and ≥3.2 for development of insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose/type 2 diabetes. more... #> 568                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), blood stasis syndrome (BSS) is mainly manifested by the increase of blood viscosity, platelet adhesion rate and aggregation, and the change of microcirculation, resulting in vascular endothelial injury.

We recently identified five clusters of placentas within a large gene expression microarray dataset (N=330, GSE75010), of which four contained a substantial number of PE samples. However, while transcriptional analysis of placentas can subtype patients, we hypothesized that the addition of epigenetic information should reveal gene regulatory mechanisms behind the distinct PE pathologies. more... #> 572                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Objective: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the homeobox transcription factor (TF) PDX1 leads to pancreatic agenesis, whereas heterozygous mutations can cause Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young 4 (MODY4). Although the function of Pdx1 is well studied in pre-clinical models during insulin-producing β-cell development and homeostasis, it remains elusive how this TF controls human pancreas development by regulating a downstream transcriptional program. more... #> 573                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We sequenced the transcriptomes of seven samples of hypothalamic neurons dervied from pluripotent stem cells taken from healthy patients; five samples of hypothalamic neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells of constitutionally obese donors; five samples of sectioned hypothalami from post-mortem dissection of brains, and two samples for motor neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells of healthy donors in order to assess the similarity of our iPSC-derived cells against those of sectioned brains and to identify possible transcriptional disfunction which might underlie extreme, inherited obesity. #> 574                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The p.R482W hotspot mutation in A-type nuclear lamins causes familial partial lipodystrophy of Dunnigantype (FPLD2), a lipodystrophic syndrome complicated by early-onset atherosclerosis.

Here we show that SRp55, a splicing factor regulated by the diabetes susceptibility gene GLIS3, has a major role in maintaining function and survival of human beta cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SRp55 regulates the splicing of genes involved in cell survival and death, insulin secretion and JNK signalling. more... #> 578                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Human ß cell dedifferentiation as a potent mechanism of diabetes is gaining prominence.

Here, we overexpressed SOX9 and a constitutively active mutant (VP16-SOX9∆TAD) in Human pancreatic beta EndoC-ßH1 cells in order to understand its targets. #> 579                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease characterized by an autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. Environmental factors such as viruses play an important role in the onset of T1D and interact with predisposing genes. Recent data suggest that viral infection of human islets leads to a decrease in insulin production rather than β cell death, suggesting loss of β cell identity. more... #> 580                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There is already strong evidence indicating that different types of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs, are key players in the regulation of β-cell functions and in the development of diabetes. However, the role of the newly discovered class of circular RNAs remains to be elucidated. We therefore analysed circular RNA expression in human islet samples. #> 581                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             BACKGROUND & AIMS: Metabolic syndrome is a newly identified risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however the molecular mechanisms still remain unclear.

Chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation are implicated in activation of the inflammatory response. Recently, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) have proved to reduce the severity of inflammatory diseases. We have previously shown that chromatin alterations regulated by HDACi in HepG2 cells stimulated by hyperglycemia reduced hepatic glucose production. more... #> 588                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is increasing constantly and various risk factors such as obesity, aging, nutritional states and physical inactivity, in addition to genetic pre-dispositions in different populations has been identified. The consequences of high blood glucose include damaged blood vessels, leading to arteriosclerosis and chronic diabetic microangiopathies. These changes lead to occlusive angiopathy, altered vascular permeability, or tissue hypoxia, resulting in complications such as heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, blindness, impaired wound healing, chronic skin ulcers, or amputations. more... #> 589                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Total RNA was isolated from WBCs. For the analysis of genome-wide expression differences in small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and long-coding and non-coding RNAs (mRNAs and lncRNAs), NGT and GDM pregnant women were selected.

To better understand molecular pathophysiology of DFUs we used patients’ specimens and genomic profiling. We identified 3900 genes specifically regulated in DFUs. Moreover, we compared DFU to human skin acute wound (AW) profiles and found DNA repair mechanisms and regulation of gene expression among the processes specifically suppressed in DFUs, whereas essential wound healing-related processes, inflammatory/immune response or cell migration, were not activated properly. more... #> 591                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Many patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have residual beta cells producing small amounts of C-peptide long after disease onset, but develop an inadequate glucagon response to hypoglycemia following T1D diagnosis. The features of these residual beta cells and alpha cells persisting in the islet endocrine compartment are largely unknown due to difficulty of comprehensive investigation. By studying the T1D pancreas and isolated islets, we show that remnant beta cells appeared to maintain several aspects of regulated insulin secretion. more... #> 592                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 593                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Pancreatic islet beta cell failure causes type 2 diabetes (T2D).

This work led to the identification of a signature of genes that were differentially expressed between T2D and ND regardless of the sample type (OD or PPP). more... #> 595                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       While histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are thought to regulate gene expression by post-translational modification of histone as well as non-histone proteins. While histone hyperacetylation has long been considered the paradigmatic mechanism of action, recent genome-wide profiles indicate more complex interactions with the epigenome. In particular, HDAC inhibitors also induce histone deacetylation at the promoters of highly active genes, resulting in gene suppression. more... #> 596

in vivo, (2) that the maturation-inhibitory effect is dependent on nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP, (3) that the developing heart accomplishes glucose deprivation condition by limiting the glucose uptake at late gestational stages during normal embryogenesis, and (4) that perturbation of the glucose deprivation in gestational diabetes affects natural cardiomyocyte maturation and potentially contributes to congenital heart disease. #> 598

insulin resistance. These dysregulations were closely associated with an amplification of intestinal lipogenesis and lipoprotein output, which was triggered by insulin resistance likely sustained by oxidative stress and inflammation. The aim of the study was to identify the genes deregulated by the presence of systemic insulin resistance in the intestine of severely obese subjects. more... #> 599

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is found in two thirds of patients at the time of diagnosis, is the primary cause of death in these patients. more... #> 603                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic failure such as cancer. Here we describe a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from donors, spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. more... #> 604                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and the five-year survival rate remains low in patients with advanced OSCC. Many studies indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs) may paly critical roles in OSCC carcinogenesis, but the dynamic composition and functions of miRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks in OSCC pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Thus, detailed investigations of OSCC-associated miRNAs and their regulated networks may provide insights into mechanistic understanding of OSCC progression and development of new strategies of OSCC management. more... #> 605                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Circulating ex-RNAs altered in plasma after acute exercise target pathways involved in inflammation, including miR-181b-5p. #> 606                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is growing evidence that transplantation of cadaveric human islets is an effective therapy for type 1 diabetes. However, gauging the suitability of islet samples for clinical use remains a challenge. We hypothesized that islet quality is reflected in the expression of specific genes.

In this study, we assessed whether epigenetic marks in blood of newborn children were associated with BMI and insulin sensitivity later in childhood. more... #> 608                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from an autoimmune attack against the insulin-producing ß cells which leads to chronic hyperglycemia. Exosomes are lipid vesicles derived from cellular multivesicular bodies that are enriched in specific miRNAs, potentially providing a disease-specific diagnostic signature. To assess the value of exosome miRNAs as biomarkers for T1DM, miRNA expression in plasma-derived exosomes was measured. more... #> 609                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The epigenome is often deregulated in cancer and treatment with inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal proteins, the readers of epigenetic acetylation marks, represents a novel therapeutic approach.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), antioxidant defences, and cellular redox status state play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and are involved in diabetes and metabolic syndromes as in aging. more... #> 612                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Novel strategies are needed to modulate β-cell differentiation and function as potential β-cell replacement or restorative therapies for diabetes. We previously demonstrated that small molecules based on the isoxazole scaffold drive neuroendocrine phenotypes. The nature of the effects of isoxazole compounds on β cells was incompletely defined.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether IR per se is characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression.  We analyzed the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two groups (10 subjects each) of healthy individuals, with extreme insulin resistance or sensitivity, matched for BMI, age and gender, selected within the MultiKnowledge Study cohort (n=148). more... #> 614                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 615                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of hypoxia-regulated transcriptional mechanisms is involved in development of chronic kidney diseases (CKD).

To address this hypothesis, we assessed global miRNA expression during in vitro differentiation of muscle stem cells derived from T2DM patients and healthy controls. more... #> 618                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of pancreatic islets have reported on α- and β-cell gene expression in mice and subjects of predominantly European ancestry. We aimed to assess these findings in East-Asian islet-cells. 448 islet-cells were captured from three East-Asian non-diabetic subjects for scRNA-seq.

Epigenetic alterations are suggested as one of the possible underlying mechanisms. We measured DNA methylation using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in siblings discordant for maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which may allow possible genetic and environmental confounding effects to be reduced. more... #> 620                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Background:  Stress cardiomyopathy (SCM) is a unique form of LV dysfunction that more often occurs in women.  Patients with SCM have a higher Troponin I/B-type natriuretic peptide ratio than AMI, but little is known about other circulating proteins.  The goals of this study were to compare plasma proteins in SCM and AMI to learn about the pathophysiology of SCM and also to identify putative biomarkers of SCM. more... #> 621                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The incidence of pre-diabetes (PD) and Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) is a worldwide epidemic. African American (AA) individuals are disproportionately more likely to become diabetic than other ethnic groups. Over the long-term, metabolic complications related to diabetes result in significant alterations in growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Considering the limited exercise-related studies in the area of gene expression changes with disease progression, the objective of this study was to examine differences in exercise-induced gene expression related to the GH and IGF-1 pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy (CON) and PD AA individuals. more... #> 622                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Age-related alterations in immunity have been linked to increased incidence of infections and decreased responses to vaccines in the aging population.

NAFLD is seen as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and affects up to 70-80% of obese patients. There are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for NASH, thus the only option is lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery in order to lose weight and to improve insulin resistance. more... #> 627                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. We demonstrate that in mice obesity promotes the expansion of interleukin-6 receptor (IL6Ra)-expressing NK cells, which also express a number of other myeloid lineage genes such as the colony-stimulating-factor 1 receptor (Csf1r).

We have investigated the mechanisms through which elevated glucose levels affect tamoxifen sensitivity of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC cells. We found that MCF7 BC cell sensitivity to tamoxifen was 2-fold reduced in 25mM glucose (HG), a concentration mimicking hyperglycaemia, compared to 5.5 mM glucose (LG), resembling normal fasting glucose levels in humans. more... #> 629                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We report the RNA expression of insulin-GFP+ cells derived from CDKAL1-/- hESCs and CDKAL1-/-hESCs overexpressing MT1E #> 630                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The presence of a coding variant affecting plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels was evaluated in subjects with elevated or normal plasma levels of HDLC.

Here, we show that histone deacetylase Sirt6 protects against podocyte injury through epigenetic regulation of Notch signaling. Sirt6 is downregulated in renal biopsies from patients with podocytopathies and its expression negatively correlates withglomerular filtration rate. more... #> 632                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The dataset comprises of circulating miRNAs in human subjects with various types of liver impairments.

In this work, we performed temporal mapping of human fetal pancreatic organogenesis using cell surface markers. We demonstrate that in the human fetal pancreas at 7 weeks of development, the glycoprotein 2 (GP2) marks a multipotent cell population that will differentiate either into the acinar, ductal and endocrine lineages. more... #> 639                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with limited effective treatment options. PDAC tumors frequently harbor the constitutively activated form of KRAS which drives proliferative signaling, but directly targeting KRAS has so far been unsuccessful. To overcome this limitation, combinatorial treatment strategies have been developed to inhibit upstream activators and downstream effectors of KRAS signaling. more... #> 640                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Genome-scale DNA methylation profiling using the Infinium DNA methylation BeadChip platform and samples from normal human eye and five ocular- related diseases #> 641                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Dysregulated expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been demonstrated as being implicated in a variety of human diseases.

We previously found a gene-environment interaction between the paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R genotype and prenatal pesticide exposure leading to a cardio-metabolic risk profile at school age. However, the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been resolved. It has been hypothesized that epigenetics might be involved. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether DNA methylation patterns in blood cells were related to prenatal pesticide exposure level, PON1 Q192R genotype, and associated metabolic effects observed in the children. more... #> 643                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac rhythm disorder, is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. AF is characterized by the rapid and irregular activation of the atrium with diverse abnormalities, including electrical, structural, metabolic, neurohormonal, or molecular alterations.3 Although the pathophysiology of AF is complex, it has traditionally been treated with antiarrhythmic drugs that control the rhythm by altering cardiac electrical properties, principally by modulating ion channel function. more... #> 644                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We compared the plasma miRNA expression profiles between healthy and GDM women by microarray analysis.Our study offers new insights into circulating biomarkers of GDM and thus provides a valuable resource for future investigations. #> 645                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Skeletal muscle is one of the primary tissues involved in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Obesity is tightly associated with T2D, making it challenging to isolate specific effects attributed to the disease alone. By using an in vitro myocyte model system we were able to isolate the inherent properties retained in myocytes originating from donor muscle precursor cells, without being confounded by varying extracellular factors present in the in vivo environment of the donor. more... #> 646                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Purpose: Identification of RUNX1 via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of fibrovascular membranes in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

GDM-induced epigenetic modifications modulating gene regulation and persisting into later life are generally assumed to mediate these increased disease risks. To identify candidate genes for fetal programming, we compared genome-wide methylation patterns of fetal cord bloods (FCBs) from GDM and control pregnancies. more... #> 648                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The molecular transducers of benefits from different exercise modalities remain incompletely defined. Here we report that 12 weeks of high-intensity aerobic interval (HIIT), resistance (RT), and combined exercise training enhanced insulin sensitivity and lean mass, but only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. HIIT revealed a more robust increase in gene transcripts than other exercise modalities, particularly in older adults, although little overlap with corresponding individual protein abundance was noted. more... #> 649                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 650                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Obesity-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) fibrosis is believed to accelerate WAT dysfunction. Two progenitor populations could be distinguished in omental white adipose tissue (oWAT) of morbidly obese individuals based on CD9 expression. In addition, the frequency of CD9high progenitors in oWAT correlates with oWAT fibrosis level, insulin-resistance severity and type 2 diabetes.

Previous studies suggested that mNT and NAF-1 could function in the same pathway in cancer cells, preventing the over-accumulation of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. more... #> 652                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Open chromatin provides access to DNA binding proteins for the correct spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. Mapping chromatin accessibility has been widely used to identify the location of cis regulatory elements (CREs) including promoters and enhancers. CREs show tissue- and cell-type specificity and disease-associated variants are often enriched for CREs in the tissues and cells that pertain to a given disease. more... #> 653                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism caused by a pituitary adenoma [Cushing’s disease (CD)] is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. CD is often associated with several morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis/bone fractures, secondary infections, and increased cardiovascular mortality. While the majority (≈80%) of the corticotrophinomas visible on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging are microadenomas (MICs, <10 mm of diameter), some tumors are macroadenomas (MACs, ≥10 mm) with increased growth potential and invasiveness, exceptionally exhibiting malignant demeanor. more... #> 654                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). It is not diagnosed or managed properly in the majority of patients, because its pathogenesis remains controversial. In this study, using microarray-based genome-wide expression analyses, we sought to identify both common and distinct mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DM and DPN. The results demonstrated that down-regulation of the neurotrophin-MAPK signaling pathway may be the major mechanism of DPN pathogenesis, thus providing a potential approach for DPN treatment. #> 655                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Context: Compared with European Americans, African Americans (AAs) are more insulin resistant, have a higher insulin secretion response to glucose, and develop type 2 diabetes more often.

One promising approach is transdifferentiation of developmentally related pancreatic cell types including glucagon-producing alpha cells. In a genetic model, overexpression of the master regulatory transcription factor Pax4 or loss of its counterplayer Arx are sufficient to induce the conversion of alpha cells to functional beta-like cells. more... #> 664                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In this study, we examined the association of DNA methylation with metabolic traits in humans using adipose tissue samples from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort. The METSIM cohort has been thoroughly characterized for longitudinal clinical data of metabolic traits including a 3-point oral glucose tolerance test, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes complications, drug and diet questionnaire, as well as high density genotyping, and genome-wide expression in adipose. more... #> 665                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this study was the identification of serum microRNAs that can differentiate osteoporotic fracture patients with and without type-2 diabetes from healthy control subjects. For that purpose circulating microRNAs were profiled by real-time quantitative PCR using a custom 384-well panel in 200 µl serum samples. Univariate and multivariate statistical tools were used in order to identify single as well as combinations of circulating microRNas that were characteristic of patients with prevalent osteoporotic fractures: a qRT-PCR-based classifier consisting of miR-550a-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-32-3p and miR-486-5p can distinguish T2D women with (DMFx) and without fragility fractures (DM) with high specifitiy and sensitivity (AUC = 0.93). more... #> 666                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Islet transplantation has the potential to benefit patients with type I diabetes, but this cellular therapy is limited by a shortage of islets, which necessitates the collection or production of islets from alternative sources. If islets produced from stem cells are to be used for transplant therapy they should precisely replicate beta-cell function. Characterization of the unique molecular mechanisms underlying the beta-cell’s response to glucose stimulation will allow a better understanding of critical elements that the alternative cells must possess. more... #> 667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although patients infected by genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) with Q(70) and/or M(91)core gene mutations have an almost five-fold increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increased insulin resistance, the absence of a suitable experimental system has precluded direct experimentation on the effects of these mutations on cellular gene expression.

Twenty-seven lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers were sequenced by both exome and mRNA-seq with respective normal tissues. Somatic mutations were detected and compared with pathway deregulation, tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Results. Although somatic mutations in DNA or mRNA ranged from hundreds to thousands in each tumor, the overlap mutations between the two were only a few to a couple of hundreds. more... #> 672                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 673                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Biologic agents active in other autoimmune settings have had variable effectiveness in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) where treatment across therapeutic targets is accompanied by transient stabilization of C-peptide levels in some patients, followed by progression at the same rate as in control groups.

The aim was to assess this relationship. In a cross-sectional study, hepatic gene expression (Illumina Microarray) was first compared among 20 patients with simple steatosis (SS), 19 with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 24 healthy controls (HC). more... #> 680                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Epidemiologically related traits may share genetic risk factors, and pleiotropic analysis could identify individual loci associated with these traits. Because of their shared epidemiological associations, we conducted pleiotropic analysis of genome-wide association studies of lung cancer (12 160 lung cancer case patients and 16 838 control subjects) and cardiovascular disease risk factors (blood lipids from 188 577 subjects, type 2 diabetes from 148 821 subjects, body mass index from 123 865 subjects, and smoking phenotypes from 74 053 subjects). more... #> 681                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Here, we report a key role for the transcription factor Pax6 in the maintenance of adult beta-cell identity and function. Pax6 is down regulated in beta-cells of diabetic db/db mice and in wild type mice treated with an insulin receptor antagonist, revealing metabolic control of expression.

Only a limited number of CR studies have been performed in humans, and results put CR as a beneficial tool to decrease risk factors in several age-related diseases. The question remains at what age CR should be implemented to be most effective with respect to healthy aging. more... #> 683                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Background and Aims: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) transcription factors direct tissue specific gene regulation in liver, pancreas and kidney and are associated with diabetes.

Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value <0.05), of which 60.5% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5% hypermethylated with increasing age. more... #> 685                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  To understand organ function it is important to have an inventory of the cell types present in the tissue and of the corresponding markers that identify them. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, since reliable markers are limited.

Detecting methylation changes in blood is important as it is an easily accessible, compared to the insulin responsive tissue skeletal muscle. more... #> 687                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the major complications of diabetes. Its molecular pathology remains poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatments. Although it has been established that multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells, all contribute to inhibition of healing, less is known regarding individual contributions of each cell type. more... #> 688                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                While the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures of cells. Here, we invoked inDrop, a droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq method, to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two strains of mice. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare ghrelin-expressing epsilon-cells, exocrine cell types, vascular cells, Schwann cells, quiescent and activated pancreatic stellate cells, and four types of immune cells. more... #> 689                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The prevalence of metabolic syndrome comprising obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease has been on the rise world-wide in recent years. As non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus have their roots in prenatal development and conditions such as maternal gestational diabetes (GDM), we aimed to test this hypothesis in primary cells derived from the offspring of GDM mothers compared to control subjects. more... #> 690                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IL-6 induced STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation is enhanced in CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with T1D compared to healthy controls. Enhanced IL-6/pSTAT3 is associated with increased surface IL-6R and early clinical disease. The transcriptome of IL-6 treated CD4 T cells from T1D patients reveals upregulation of genes involved in T cell migration. more... #> 691                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to identify differentially expressed gene transcripts (DEGs) after kidney transplantation and after the start of immunosuppressive drugs. RNAseq is superior to microarray to determine DEGs because it’s not limited to available probes, has increased sensitivity, and detects alternative and previously unknown transcripts. more... #> 692                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Comparison of gene expression in pancreatic islets of BTBR-ob/ob mouse model of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes, and in non-diabetic control mice, B6-ob/ob identified Asf1b as an important gene candidate predictive of diabetic outcome. Asf1B expression was suppressed in response to age in both B6 and BTBR islets, induced by obesity only in B6 islets. This is consistent with other studies reporting a decline in -cell proliferation with age. more... #> 693                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common cancer worldwide and accounts for approximately 30% of all keratinocyte cancers.  The vast majority of cutaneous SCCs of the head and neck (cSCCHN) are readily curable with surgery and/or radiotherapy unless high-risk features are present.  Perineural invasion (PNI) is recognized as one of these high-risk features.

Therefore, the microRNA expression profiles were revisited using normal discs as control. #> 710                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            substantial number of people at risk to develop type 2 diabetes could not improve insulin sensitivity by physical training intervention. We studied the mechanisms of this impaired exercise response in 20 middle-aged individuals who performed a controlled eight weeks cycling and walking training at 80 % individual VO2max. Participants identified as non-responders in insulin sensitivity (based on Matsuda index) did not differ in pre-intervention parameters compared to high responders. more... #> 711                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        To understand organ (dys)function it is important to have a complete inventory of its cell types and the corresponding markers that unambiguously identify these cell types. This is a challenging task, in particular in human tissues, because unique cell-type markers are typically unavailable, necessitating the analysis of complex cell type mixtures. Transcriptome-wide studies on pancreatic tissue are typically done on pooled islet material. more... #> 712

We tested the hypothesis that uncontrolled expansion of diabetogenic T-cells in patients occurs, resulting from failure to activate apoptosis. We compared function, transcriptome and epigenetic regulation thereof in relation with fate upon repeated exposure to islet-autoantigen of islet autoreactive T-cells from healthy and type 1 diabetic donors with identical islet epitope specificity and HLA-A2 restriction. more... #> 717

clinical conditions during pregnancy that could result in adverse utero environments of the fetus. Fetal exposure to poor environments in uterus also raises the risk of future adulthood disorders known as fetal origins of adult disease (FOAD). Epigenetic modifications like cytosine methylation and histone modification have been proposed to be involved in FOAD. more... #> 723                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The study of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation and the role of these mechanisms in developmental reprogramming of the genome and disease susceptibility has increased in recent years. Molecular epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded RNA that regulate post-transcriptional control of the translation of mRNA. more... #> 724                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Intensive efforts are focused on identifying regulators of human pancreatic islet cell growth and maturation to accelerate development of therapies for diabetes. After birth, islet cell growth and function are dynamically regulated; however, establishing these age-dependent changes in humans has been challenging. Here we describe a multimodal strategy for isolating pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells from children and adults to identify age-dependent gene expression and chromatin changes on a genomic scale. more... #> 725                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         We report a mechanism through which the transcription machinery directly controls topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity to adjust DNA topology throughout the transcription cycle. By comparing TOP1 occupancy using ChIP-Seq, versus TOP1 activity using TOP1-Seq, a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. more... #> 726                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current therapy has turned HIV infection into a chronic condition. Clinically, some patients suffer prematurely from ailments associated with advanced age; however, the relationship between HIV and aging is unclear. Here we have collected a large cohort of HAART treated HIV+ subjects with both recent and chronic infection and recapitulated the shared phenotype of HIV and age. To further understand this signal, we applied validated models of DNA methylation-based biological age to establish a clear link between HIV infection and molecular age advancement. more... #> 727                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We recently reported the scalable in vitro production of functional stem cell-derived β cells.  Here we extend this approach to generate SC-β cells from Type 1 diabetic patients (T1D), a cell type that is destroyed during disease progression and has not been possible to extensively study.  These cells express β cell markers, respond to glucose both in vitro and in vivo, prevent alloxan-induced diabetes in mice, and respond to anti-diabetic drugs. more... #> 728                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease associated with many underlying pathomechanisms.

Pericyte loss is one of the pathologic cellular events in DR, which weakens the retinal microvessels. Damages to the microvascular networks are irreversible and permanent, thus further progression of DR is inevitable. In this study, we hypothesize that multipotent perivascular progenitor cells derived from human ESCs (hESC-PVPCs) improve the damaged retinal vasculature in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rodent models. more... #> 738                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is currently the most prevalent arrhythmia worldwide.Recent clinical data implicate the additional contribution of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of AF，which include microRNAs(miRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs, PIWIinteracting RNAs, and lncRNA.

CD4+ T cells are integral to the pathogenesis of T1D, but biomarkers that define their pathogenic status in T1D are lacking. miRNAs have essential functions in a wide range of tissues/organs, including the immune system. We reasoned that CD4+ T cells from individuals at high risk for T1D (pre-T1D) might be distinguished by an miRNA signature. more... #> 745                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Objective: Although glucagon-secreting α-cells and insulin-secreting β-cells have opposing functions in regulating plasma glucose levels, the two cell types share a common developmental origin and have overlaps in their transcriptome and epigenome profiles.

To identify the potential genes whose expression changed in response to high glucose, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression in the RNAKT-15 cells for 48 h. more... #> 747                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The presence of a coding variant affecting plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels  was evaluated in subjects with elevated plasma levels of HDLC. #> 748                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The obese people with abnormal BMI are predisposed to insulin resistance and diabetes. At the same time, human subjects with obesity and high BMI that are otherwise insulin sensitive are an interesting group to study the underlying gene expression patterns which provide them with such protective phenotype. Objective: Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the earliest predictors of type 2 diabetes. However, diagnosis of IR is limited. more... #> 749

Onset of complications (arteriosclerosis and renal damage) due to Type 2 diabetes is well documented; it is extremely important to prevent or delay their progression. Type 2 diabetes onset and progression has been controlled through dietary habits and exercise, although these remain insufficient. Chlorella ingestion improves blood glucose and cholesterol concentrations in mice and humans, although no reports have evaluated Chlorella effects in borderline diabetics. more... #> 764                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ChIP-seq of H3K27ac was performed in regulatory T cells (resting and activated) and conventional T cells (naïve, effector, memory) in mouse and human.  A small number of regulatory elements were lineage specific in both mouse and human and represented the 'core' lineage specification program.  Regulatory element acetylation levels were associated with genetic variation in humans and lineage-specific loci were enriched for autoimmune risk-alleles (especially type 1 diabetes) identified in classic and fine-resolution genome-wide association studies. #> 765                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.  Previously, we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC). more... #> 766                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Background: Blocking the action of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) reduces beta-cell secretory dysfunction and apoptosis in vitro, diabetes incidence in animal models of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and glycaemia via improved beta-cell function in patients with T2D.

ERK signaling displayed the greatest variation, which led to extensive variation in expression of downstream target genes. Our results suggest that phenotypic variation in kinase signaling mediates variation in downstream processes of insulin response. more... #> 774                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Adipose tissues play an important role in the pathophysiology of obesity-related disease including type 2 diabetes.

However, human islet cell expansion in culture results in loss of β-cell phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process activates expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, two members of the zinc-finger homeobox family of E-cadherin repressors, which play key roles in EMT. more... #> 776                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The project is directed to the development of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists for anticancer therapy.

remains poorly defined. Considerable research has been conducted to accurately distinguish patients with sepsis from those with non-infectious causes of disease. Technological innovations have positioned systems biology at the forefront of biomarker discovery. Analysis of the whole-blood leukocyte transcriptome enables the assessment of thousands of molecular signals beyond simply measuring several proteins in plasma, which for use as biomarkers is important since combinations of biomarkers likely provide more diagnostic accuracy than the measurement of single ones or a few. more... #> 781                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically in recent decades. Increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and activity has recently emerged as an interesting approach to not only increase energy expenditure, but also improve glucose homeostasis. BAT can be recruited by prolonged cold exposure in lean, healthy humans. Here, we tested whether cold acclimation could have therapeutic value for patients with type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity. more... #> 782                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We performed gene expression microarray analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies from normal glucose tolerant subjects and type 2 diabetes subjects obtained during a 60 min bicycle ergometer exercise and the 180 min of recovery phase #> 783                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the need to improve diagnostic strategies.

Here we show that gene-expression profiles based on microarray analysis can be used to predict patient survival in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas. Genes most related to survival were identified with univariate Cox analysis. Using either two equivalent but independent training and testing sets, or 'leave-one-out' cross-validation analysis with all tumors, a risk index based on the top 50 genes identified low-risk and high-risk stage I lung adenocarcinomas, which differed significantly with respect to survival. more... #> 792                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Arsenic (As) exposure is a significant worldwide environmental health concern. Low dose, chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with higher risk of skin, lung, and bladder cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  While arsenic-induced biological changes play a role in disease pathology, little is known about the dynamic cellular changes due to arsenic exposure and withdrawal.  In these studies, we seek to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the biological changes induced by chronic low doses of arsenic exposure. more... #> 793                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 794                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic, severe disease rapidly increasing in incidence and prevalence and is associated with numerous complications.

This complex disease involves systemic metabolic changes and their elucidation at the systems level requires genome-wide data and biological networks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a network-context to integrate high-throughput data.

Several factors like genetic, environmental and biochemical are involved in the development of DR. However, the inheritance pattern of this disease is multi factorial resulting from the interaction of one or more genes but the exact mechanism is not completely understood. Over the decade there has been alot of molecular genetics work done in nuclear genome for DR in different ethnic groups and  identified several candidate genes involved in disease pathogenesis but the role of these genes in the development of disease is not yet clearly understood. more... #> 805                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Age-related changes in DNA methylation occurring in blood leukocytes during early childhood may reflect epigenetic maturation. We hypothesized that some of these changes involve gene networks of critical relevance in leukocyte biology and conducted a prospective study to elucidate the dynamics of DNA methylation.

Pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) are an essential site for the development of T1D, where tolerance to pancreatic self-antigens is first broken and the autoimmune responses are amplified. The purpose of this study was to identify candidate genes and pathways in the PLN that may contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D. #> 807                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Despite the significant reduction in the overall burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the past decade, CVD still accounts for a third of all deaths in the United States and worldwide each year. While efforts to identify and reduce risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease (i.e. hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, inactivity) remain the focus of primary prevention, the inability to accurately and temporally predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) impairs our ability to further improve patient outcomes. more... #> 808                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Due to an increasingly aging population, the incidence of dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease are steadily rising, with recent estimates predicting >115million dementia sufferers by 2050.

The gene ontology (GO), pathway and network analysis were performed. more... #> 811                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The objective of this study was to examine relationships between weight loss through changes in lifestyle and peripheral blood gene expression profiles. Substantial weight loss (-15.2+3.8%) in lifestyle participants was associated with improvement in selected cardiovascular risk factors and significant changes in peripheral blood gene expression from pre- to post-intervention: 132 unique genes showed significant expression changes related to immune function and inflammatory responses involving endothelial activation. more... #> 812                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 813                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We performed global microRNA expression profiling of a cohort of primary melanoma patient samples linked to a well-annotated clinical database. The goal of this study was to identify microRNA that are associated to or correlated with various clinical parameters and patient outcomes. Candidate microRNA were identified for building prognostic models and functional testing. #> 814                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and increased intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, which are key risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, a subset of obese people does not develop these metabolic complications. We tested the hypothesis that MNO, but not MAO, people are protected from the adverse metabolic effects of weight gain. To this end, global transcriptional profile in adipose tissue before and after weight gain was evaluated by microarray analyses. #> 815                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Using a functional approach to investigate the epigenetics of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), we combine three lines of evidence – diet-induced epigenetic dysregulation in mouse, epigenetic conservation in humans, and T2D clinical risk evidence – to identify genes implicated in T2D pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms related to obesity. Beginning with dietary manipulation of genetically homogeneous mice, we identify differentially DNA-methylated genomic regions. more... #> 816                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This study compared whole transcriptome signatures of 6 immune cell subsets and whole blood from patients with an array of immune-associated diseases.

One promising  approach has been to increase the number or activity of brown-like adipocytes in white  adipose depots, as this has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity and reduce the  incidence and severity of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the conversion of fat-storing cells into  metabolically active thermogenic cells has become an appealing therapeutic strategy to  combat obesity. more... #> 824                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            FUS-CHOP and EWS-CHOP balanced translocations characterize myxoid liposarcoma which encompasses myxoid (ML) and round cell (RC) variants initially believed to be distinct diseases.

Four pancreatic tumors from patients with PCA-DM (A1-A4), four pancreatic tumors from patients without PCA-DM (B1-B4), and four pancreatic tissues from patients with pancreatitis were individually profiled with Agilent microarrays(Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0). #> 832                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is one phenotype of asthma, often in the form of a severe and sudden attack. Due to time consuming and laborious oral aspirin challenge (OAC) for diagnosis of AERD, non-invasive biomarkers have been searched.

Dedifferentiation is associated with changes resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). more... #> 836                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      By restraining T cell activation and promoting regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC) (tDC) can control self-reactive and anti-graft effector T cells in autoimmunity and transplantation. Their therapeutic use and characterization, however, is limited by their scarce availability in the peripheral blood of tumor-free donors. In the present study we describe and characterize a novel population of myeloid suppressor cells, named fibrocytic MDSC (f-MDSC), that are differentiated from umbilical cord blood (UCB) precursors by a 4 day culture with FDA approved cytokines (rh-GM-CSF and rh-G-CSF). more... #> 837                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Ras-related associated with diabetes (RRAD) is a small Ras-related GTPase that is frequently inactivated by DNA methylation of the CpG island in its promoter region in cancer tissues.

Despite the recent advance in the treatment of PDR such as vitreoretinal surgery with use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drug as an adjunct, it still remains vision-threatening disease. In order to identify genes associated with the pathogenesis of PDR, we performed gene expression analyses in fibrovascular membrane in patients with PDR using DNA microarray technology. #> 841                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 842                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease mediated by autoimmune attack against pancreatic b cells.

Several auto-antibodies including GADA, IA-2A, and ZnT8A, were identified in T1DM, but the prevalence of these auto-antibodies varied for a broad spectrum of T1DM. Here, we systemically profiled auto-antibodies from serum samples of 16 T1DM, 16 type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients, and 27 healthy controls with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) using protein microarrays containing 9,480 proteins. more... #> 845                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Here we harnessed the potential of expression arrays in 89 human pancreatic islet donors (different levels of blood glucose (HbA1c)) to identify genes regulated in this relevant tissue for type 2 diabetes (T2D). #> 846                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Mi(cro)RNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.

Cell-cell communication between the maternal endometrium and the pre-implantation embryo can occur by several means. Here, we show that maternal miRNAs are secreted by the endometrial epithelium to the endometrial fluid. Microarray assessments revealed the presence of specific miRNAs that are associated with the window of implantation and therefore in direct contact with the human preimplantation embryo. more... #> 849                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 850                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Low aerobic exercise capacity is a risk factor for diabetes and strong predictor of mortality; yet some individuals are exercise resistant, and unable to improve exercise capacity through exercise training. To test the hypothesis that resistance to aerobic exercise training underlies metabolic disease-risk, we used selective breeding for 15 generation to develop rat models of low- and high-aerobic response to training. more... #> 851                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.

However, it is unknown to what extent this modulation is achieved through DNA methylation. We assessed the effects of cholesterol intake, the proportion of energy intake derived from fat, the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to saturated fatty acids (SFA), the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to SFA, and the ratio of (MUFA+PUFA) to SFA on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in normal-weight and obese children. more... #> 853                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Obesity is associated with a chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation that may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Resveratrol, a natural compound with anti-inflammatory properties, is shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese mice and humans. Here we tested the effect of a 2-year resveratrol administration on the pro-inflammatory profile and insulin resistance caused by a high-fat, high-sugar (HFS) diet in white adipose tissue (WAT) from rhesus monkeys. more... #> 854                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              To identify genes with expression levels that are associated with T1D progression from AbP (islet autoantibody positive),   global gene expression changes were analyzed in AbP subjects with different T1D progression rate. #> 855                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Monozygotic (MZ) twin pair discordance for childhood-onset Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is ~50%, implicating roles for genetic and non-genetic factors in the aetiology of this complex autoimmune disease. Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of T1D in recent years, the non-genetic component has remained poorly defined. We hypothesized that epigenetic variation could underlie some of the non-genetic component of T1D aetiology and, thus, performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for this disease. more... #> 856                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Access to an unlimited number of human pancreatic beta cells represents a major challenge in the field of diabetes to better dissect human beta cell functions and to make significant progress in drug discovery and cell replacement therapies.

Intriguingly, human pancreatic islets express many complement genes. The most highly expressed gene was the complement inhibitor CD59 that is GPI anchored to the cell membrane, which unexpectedly was found in high amounts intracellularly in beta cells. Silencing of CD59 strongly suppressed insulin secretion. more... #> 860                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Intensive lifestyle modification is believed to mediate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through traditional pathways that affect endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis; however, the extent, persistence, and clinical significance of molecular change during lifestyle modification are not well known. Our study reveals that gene expression signatures are significantly modulated by rigorous lifestyle behaviors and track with CVD risk profiles over time. #> 861                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    To unravel genes and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of prospective venous blood samples from children developing T1D-associated autoantibodies or progressing towards clinical diagnosis. #> 862                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

perinatal complications and predisposes for offspring obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. Emerging evidence implicates changes in placental function in altered fetal growth and the subsequent development of adult disease.  The susceptibility for disease in response to an adverse intrauterine environment differs distinctly between boys and girls, with girls typically having better outcomes. more... #> 880                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We compared human female hiPSC lines (all derived from IMR-90 fibroblasts) that were XIST RNA-positive and XIST RNA-negative.

We identified a cluster of miRNAs in an imprinted locus on human chromosome 14q32 that is highly and specifically expressed in human β-cells and dramatically down-regulated in islets from T2DM organ donors. more... #> 885                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          MicroRNAs are powerful gene expression regulators, but their corneal repertoire and potential changes in corneal diseases remain unknown.

We hypothesize that these changes exist prior to OLT and may play a role in the development of renal failure after OLT. We use gene expression microarrays to investigate the mechanism of kidney disease in patients listed for OLT. Gene expression profiles of biopsies of cirrhotic patients were compared with pre-implantation living donor biopsies. more... #> 893                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Regulatory T cells (Treg) prevent the emergence of autoimmune disease. Prototypic natural Treg (nTreg) are programmed by Forkhead-box P3 (FOXP3) and can be reliably identified by demethylation at the FOXP3 locus. To explore the nTreg methylation landscape we performed genome-wide methylation studies on human naïve resting nTreg (rTreg) and conventional naïve CD4+ T cells (Naïve). We detected 2,315 differentially methylated CpGs between these two cell types, many of which clustered into 127 regions of differential methylation (RDMs). more... #> 894                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tissues from another series of 74 patients with colorectal cancer were collected by laser micro-dissection with the Leica Laser Microdissection System (Leica Microsystems). #> 895                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Insulin-secreting β cells and glucagon-secreting α cells maintain physiological blood glucose levels, and their malfunction drives diabetes development. Using ChIP sequencing and RNA sequencing analysis, we determined the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of human pancreatic α, β, and exocrine cells. We found that, compared with exocrine and β cells, differentiated α cells exhibited many more genes bivalently marked by the activating H3K4me3 and repressing H3K27me3 histone modifications. more... #> 896                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Diabetes and obesity are widespread diseases with signifciant socioeconomic implications.

In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from three types of adipose tissue; epigastric, subcutaneous, and visceral all obtained through open gastric bypass surgery. #> 897                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  To search for new markers of active lesions that might help better understand the molecular basis of MPA and aid in its diagnosis, DNA microarray analysis was performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). #> 898                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Primary endothelial cells from umbilical cord vein (HUVEC) obtained at delivery from gestational diabetic (GD) women, represent an expedient model for the study of the effects of chronic HG in vivo.

We have utilized this model to study the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the transcriptome and to verify the presence of specific epigenetic changes associated to chronic HG in vascular cells. #> 899                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Inherited genetic variants of insulin receptor induced cellular signaling have long been suspected to contribute to the development of type-2- diabetes mellitus.

The ubiquitous immediate-early gene c-fos is one essential transcription factor to initiate adipocyte differentiation. In a CGL patient we identified a single homozygous point mutation in the promoter of c-fos gene. The mutation facilitates the formation of a novel specific protein/ DNA complex and ubiquitously reduces basal and inducible c-fos transcription activity. more... #> 901                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 902                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        To identify genes with cell-lineage-specific expression not accessible by experimental micro-dissection, we developed a genome-scale iterative method, in-silico nano-dissection, which leverages high-throughput functional-genomics data from tissue homogenates using a machine-learning framework.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important component of regulatory control, and have proven roles in the development of human disease and control of glucose homeostasis. We set out to establish the miRNA profile of human pancreatic islets and of enriched beta-cell populations, and to explore their potential involvement in T2D susceptibility. more... #> 909                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 910                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      A need exists for biomarkers in T1D that can 1) sensitively and specifically detect disease-related immune activity prior to, and independent of, measurement of auto-antibodies towards islet cell antigens; 2) define immunopathological mechanisms; and 3) monitor changes in the inflammatory state associated with disease progression or response to therapeutic intervention.  In an effort to fill this gap, we have applied a novel bioassay to both human and BB rat T1D whereby the complex milieu of inflammatory mediators present in plasma can be indirectly detected through their ability to drive transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells drawn from healthy, unrelated donors. more... #> 911

                  Transcription has the capacity to modify mechanically DNA topology, DNA structure, and nucleosome arrangement. Resulting from ongoing transcription, these modifications in turn, may provide instant feedback to the transcription machinery. To substantiate the connection between transcription and DNA dynamics, we charted an ENCODE map of transcription-dependent dynamic supercoiling in human Burkitt lymphoma cells using psoralen photobinding to probe DNA topology in vivo. more... #> 919                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Nuclear RNA from Raji human B cells was hybridized to NimbleGen arrays to quantify gene expression levels. #> 920                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In this study, we examined the impact of modulating the TGF-β/PAI-1 axis in CD34+ cells function from diabetic patients and controls.  Using gene array studies, we found that diabetics, protected from microvascular complications despite suboptimal glycemic control, had reduced level of TGF- β1 and PAI-1 transcripts in their CD34+ cells compared to age, sex, duration and degree of glycemic control -matched diabetics with microvascular complications. more... #> 921                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Objective was to examine acute gene expression responses to physiologic oral glucose ingestion in human circulating leukocytes.

The present study demonstrated 36 genes which showed acute gene expression change in human leukocytes within 1 hour after glucose ingestion and suggest that leukocytes participate in the inflammatory process induced by acute hyperglycemia. #> 922                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This study employed Affymetrix GeneChips to profile transcriptome of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with PBEFsiRNA to gain insight into transcriptional regulations of PBEF on the endothelial function.

Most of these patients are treated with platinum-based chemotherapies, but there is no biomarker model to guide their responses to these therapeutic agents.   We have developed and independently tested our novel multivariate molecular predictors for forecasting patients' responses to individual drugs on a cohort of 58 ovarian cancer patients. more... #> 943                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A study which examines differences in microRNA expression profiles across different sarcoma histological subtypes #> 944                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Aims/hypothesis: Duct cells isolated from adult human pancreas can be reprogrammed to express islet beta cell genes by adenoviral transduction of the developmental transcription factor neurogenin3 (Ngn3).

One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding  to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in 6 human cell lines.

We isolated the amorfrutins from edible parts of the plants Glychyrrhiza foetida and Amorpha fruticosa, and identified these natural products as a new chemical class to treat insulin resistance and diabetes by selectively activating PPARγ. more... #> 961                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still very poor, how to detect pancreatic cancer from high-risk group in an early stage is essential for improving its long-time survival. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore specific biomarkers that can differentiate pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes from type-2 diabetes for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. In the current study, we used global gene transcription analysis with affymetrix gene chip to identify genes specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes mellitus from peripheral blood samples in stead of from tissue samples. #> 962                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   SPARC is  a matricellular glycoprotein that plays critical roles in the pathologies associated with obesity and diabetes, as well as tumorigenesis.

However, definitions of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small for gestational age (SGA) are based on simple statistical approaches that may misclassify infants with a normal developmental profile and vice versa. We used an unbiased global profiling approach to identify gene expression patterns in umbilical cord tissue from 38 infants and identified a set of 466 genes which separated the subjects into 2 distinct groups – one biased towards lower birth weight and one biased towards normal birth weight. more... #> 981                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Inter-individual DNA methylation variations were frequently hypothesized to alter individual susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1,169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. more... #> 982                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 983                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The exchange of the oocyte's genome with the genome of a somatic cell, followed by the derivation of pluripotent stem cells, could enable the generation of specific cell types affected in degenerative human diseases.

Fixation with formalin, a widely adopted procedure to preserve tissue samples, leads to extensive degradation of nucleic acids and thereby compromises procedures like microarray-based gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that RNA fragmentation is caused by activation of RNAses during the interval between formalin penetration and tissue fixation. To prevent RNAse activation, a series of tissue samples were kept under-vacuum at 4°C until fixation and then fixed at 4°C, for 24 hours, in formalin followed by 4 hours in ethanol 95%. more... #> 987                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Background: Changes in DNA methylation patterns with age frequently have been observed and implicated in the normal aging process and its associated increasing risk of disease, particularly cancer.

Only a proportion of these increased risks among the children of older parents can be attributed to nondisjunction and chromosomal rearrangements. more... #> 988                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tissues from another series of 132 patients with colorectal cancer were collected by laser micro-dissection with the Leica Laser Microdissection System (Leica Microsystems). #> 989                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Samples were prospectively collected from patients with histologically normal surgical resection margins. 96 tissue samples (histologically normal margins, oral carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues) from 24 patients comprised the training set. Our study design was guided by the hypothesis that the expression of genes present in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) but not in healthy oral tissues would be indicative of recurrence in advance of histological alteration. more... #> 990                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We identified 1,700 differentially expressed probesets in DKD glomeruli and 1,831 in diabetic tubuli; 330 probesets were commonly differentially expressed in both compartments. The canonical complement signaling pathway was determined to be statistically differentially regulated in both DKD glomeruli and tubuli and was associated with increased glomerulosclerosis even in an additional set of DKD samples. #> 991                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We identified 1,700 differentially expressed probesets in DKD glomeruli and 1,831 in diabetic tubuli; 330 probesets were commonly differentially expressed in both compartments.

Despite similar propensities for obesity, Hispanics and African Americans exhibit unique and distinct differences in obesity related outcomes such as greater risk of, obesity-related cancers in AA and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Hispanics. This study was aimed to determine whether differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression in obese, Hispanic and AA young adults might explain ethnic differences in obesity-related phenotypes. #> 995                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aims: establishment of reference samples to investigate gene expression selective for endocrine or ductal-exocrine cells within the adult human pancreas.

However, while evidence supports the replicative capacity of adult beta cells in vivo, attempts at expanding human islet cells in tissue culture resulted in loss of beta-cell phenotype.

Additional genes involved in metabolic processes and mitochondrial function were found to be up-regulated in the adipose tissue of HIV-positive patients compared with HIV-negative controls. #> 998                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Dysregulation of ceramide synthesis has been associated with metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. Using a human hepatoma cell line (Huh7), we investigated the changes in lipid homeostasis and gene expression when the synthesis of ceramide is perturbed by knocking down serine transferases subunits 1, 2 and 3 (SPTLC123) or dihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS1). While the inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPTLC) affects ceramide production differently at the subspecies level depending upon which SPTLC subunit is silenced; depleting DEGS1 is sufficient to produce a similar outcome as knocking down all SPTLC subunits. more... #> 999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #> 1000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The aim of this study was to characterize expression profiles of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in children. Adipose tissue samples were collected from children having elective surgery (n=71, [54 boys], 6.0 +- 4.3 years). Affymetrix microarrays (n=20) were performed to characterize the functional profile and identify genes of interest in adipose tissue. Visceral adipose tissue had an overrepresentation of Gene Ontology themes related to immune and inflammatory responses and subcutaneous adipose tissue had an overrepresentation of themes related to adipocyte growth and development. more... #> 1001                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Adipose tissue abundance relies partly on the factors that regulate adipogenesis, i.e. proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes. While the transcriptional program that initiates adipogenesis is well-known, the importance of microRNAs in adipogenesis is less well studied. We thus set out to investigate whether miRNAs would be actively modulated during adipogenesis and obesity. Several models exist to study adipogenesis in vitro, of which the cell line 3T3-L1 is probably the most well known, albeit not the most physiologically appropriate. more... #> 1002                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            We use ChIP-seq to discover the genome-wide sites of acetylation of lysine 56 of the histone H3 (H3K56), which is a target of three histone modifying enzymes with known roles in diabetes and insulin resistance, in human adipocytes derived from mesenchymal stem cells. Surprisingly, we find that a very large fraction of genes show some level of acetylation on H3K56, but the highest levels of acetylation are associated with genes previously reported to be involved  in type 2 diabetes. more... #> 1003                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               TGFbeta is the major cytokine driver of fibrosis in the kidney and other tissue.

Th1 lymphocytes are responsible for the infiltration of the islets of Langerhans and for the cytokine release that supports cytotoxic (Tc) lymphocytes to mediate destruction of the beta cells. The preclinical disease stage is characterized by the generation of the self-reactive lymphocytes that infiltrate the pancreas and selectively destroy the insulin-producing beta cells present in the islets. more... #> 1006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        HNF4a is an important liver transcription factor that regulates at least a thousand genes in the liver.

However, molecular mediators of insulin resistance remain unclear. We find that the top-ranking gene set in expression analysis of muscle from humans with T2D and normoglycemic insulin resistant subjects with parental family history (FH+) of T2D is increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator MKL1. more... #> 1008                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Insulin (INS) synthesis and secretion from pancreatic β cells are tightly regulated;  their deregulation causes diabetes. Here we map INS-associated loci in human  pancreatic islets by 4C and 3C techniques and show that the INS gene physically  interacts with the SYT8 gene, located over 300 kb away. This interaction is  elevated by glucose and accompanied by increases in SYT8 expression.  Inactivation of the INS promoter by promoter-targeting siRNA reduces SYT8  gene expression. more... #> 1009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has a large number of biological effects, including skin, cardiovascular, neurologic disease, diabetes, infertility and cancer.

In light of this, and contradicting reports regarding discordant copy number profiles between MZ twins(BARANZINI et al. 2010; BRUDER et al. 2008), we set out to identify de novo somatic copy number mutations in DNA from blood for MZ twin pairs of Mexican American descent who were participants of the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) or San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder study (SAFDGS).

The World Health Organization anticipates that these numbers will double in the next 20 years. Metabolic syndrome is a well recognized set of symptoms that increases a patient’s risk of developing diabetes.  Insulin resistance is a factor in both metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by decreased insulin stimulated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, decreased adiponectin levels, increased adipocyte  FFA and cytokine production, and increased insulin and hepatic glucose output. more... #> 1021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is secondary to T2DM and can be improved by long-term regular exercise training  Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated to play a causative role in development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, a growing number of recent studies provide data that mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of T2DM development. The aim of our study is to clarify in further detail the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in T2DM by a comprehensive ex vivo analysis of mitochondrial function combined with global gene expression analysis in muscle of pre-diabetic newly diagnosed untreated T2DM subjects and long-standing insulin treated T2DM subjects compared with age- and BMI-matched controls. more... #> 1022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The orphan nuclear receptor TR4 (human testicular receptor 4 or NR2C2) plays a pivotal role in a variety of biological and metabolic processes. With no known ligand and few known target genes, the mode of TR4 function was unclear. We report the first genome-wide identification and characterization of TR4 in vivo binding. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified TR4 binding sites in 4 different human cell types and found that the majority of target genes were shared among different cells. more... #> 1023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Genome scale characterization of chromatin modification, RNA expression, and cytosine methylation in a diverse panel of primary human cells and tissues, stem cells, and iPS cells derived from deidentified human subjects  **************** For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nih-common-fund/epigenomics-data-access-policies **************** #> 1024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Identifying cis-regulatory elements is important to understand how human pancreatic islets modulate gene expression in physiologic or pathophysiologic (e.g., diabetic) conditions. We conducted genome-wide analysis of DNase I hypersensitive sites, histone H3 lysine methylation marks (K4me1, K4me3, K79me2), and CCCTC factor (CTCF) binding in human islets. This identified ~18,000 putative promoters (several hundred novel and islet-active). more... #> 1025                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Congenital hypothyroidism from thyroid dysgenesis (CHTD) is a sporadic disease characterized by defects in the differentiation, migration or growth of thyroid tissue. Of these defects, incomplete migration resulting in ectopic thyroid tissue is the most common (up to 80%).

Human embryonic stem (hES) cells possess unlimited self-renewal and pluripotency and thus have the potential to provide an unlimited supply of different cell types for tissue replacement. The hES-T3 cells with normal female karyotype were first differentiated into embryoid bodies and then induced to generate the pancreatic islet-like cell clusters, which expressed pancreatic islet cell-specific markers of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin. more... #> 1027                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes.  While multiple pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of DN, there are no specific treatments for DN and currently it is not possible to predict DN onset or progression. To examine gene expression signatures related to DN, microarray experiments were performed on a subset of human sural nerves collected during a 52-week clinical trial of acetyl-L-carnitine. more... #> 1028                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rationale: Physical inactivity is a risk factor for insulin resistance. We examined the effect of nine days of bed rest on basal and insulin stimulated expression of genes potentially involved in insulin action by applying hypothesis-generating microarray in parallel with candidate gene real-time PCR approaches in 20 healthy, young men. Furthermore, we investigated whether bed rest affected DNA methylation in the promoter region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) gene. more... #> 1029                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Inflammation is common to many disorders and responsible for tissue and organ damage. However, the associated peripheral cytokine milieu is frequently dilute and difficult to measure, necessitating development of more sensitive and informative biomarkers for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, and monitoring therapeutic interventions.

To identify hepatic secretory proteins involved in insulin resistance, we performed liver biopsies in humans with or without type 2 diabetes and conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles. #> 1037                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Glomerular diseases account for the majority of cases with chronic renal failure. Several genes have been identified with key relevance for glomerular function. Quite a few of these genes show a specific or preferential mRNA expression in the renal glomerulus. To identify additional candidate genes involved in glomerular function in humans we generated a human renal glomerulus-specific transcript dataset (GTD) by comparing gene expression profiles from human glomeruli and tubulointerstitium obtained from six transplant living donors using Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. more... #> 1038                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Insulin is a potent pleiotropic hormone that affects processes such as cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, ion flux, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism.

However, it is not known whether insulin itself could increase the transcription of specific genes for cellular proliferation in the endothelium. Hence, the characterization of transcriptional modifications in endothelium is an important step for a better understanding of the mechanism of insulin action and the relationship between endothelial cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. more... #> 1040                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Objective: Potential regulators of adipogenesis include microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that have been recently shown related to adiposity and differentially expressed in fat depots.

Thereby, the aim of this study was to investigate whether miRNA expression profile in human adipocytes is related to adipogenesis and to test whether miRNA profile in human subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated to human obesity and co-morbidities. more... #> 1041                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In this study, we compared the expression profiles of miRNAs in blood samples from Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and T2D male patients. Healthy adult males with no past history of T2D (n=158) and with desirable cholesterol and blood pressure profiles were enrolled in this study. They were then classified according to fasting glucose levels to have T2D, IFG or as healthy controls (CTL), for comparison of miRNA expression profiles. more... #> 1042                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Epidemiological studies have revealed concurrence of specific cancers with other disease states such as metabolic syndrome, inflammatory disease and autoimmune disease. Patients with these chronic conditions have a higher incidence of various cancers, more aggressive tumors, and a higher mortality rate. It has been proposed that obesity, inflammation and chronic disease should be correlated with cancer at the molecular level, but common gene signatures or networks have yet to be described. more... #> 1043                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. In high-risk subjects, the earliest detectable abnormality is insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.

Failure to restore homeostasis in the ER is associated with human diseases. To identify the underlying changes in gene expression in response to ER stress, we induced ER stress in human B-cells and then measured gene expression at 10 time-points. more... #> 1045                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Changes in gene expression in pancreatic beta-cells from type 2 diabetes could provide insights into their abnormal insulin secretion and beta-cell turnover. The laser capture microdissection technique was used to acquire beta-cells from pancreatic tissue sections obtained from type 2 diabetic (T2D) and non-diabetic controls. We found that 4% of analyzed transcripts were differentially expressed between the two groups at the lower confidence bound cutoff of 1.2, and, among the differentially expressed transcripts, 62% were up-regulated and 38% down-regulated in samples of T2D subjects compared to non-diabetic controls. more... #> 1046                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in whole blood samples from a case-control study of 192 Irish patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Cases had T1D and nephropathy whereas controls had T1D but no evidence of renal disease. emails: christopher.bell@cancer.ucl.ac.uk, a.teschendorff@ucl.ac.uk  Keywords: DNA methylation #> 1047                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Perturbations of the intrauterine environment can affect fetal development during critical periods of plasticity, and can increase susceptibility to a number of age-related diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus; T2DM), manifesting sometimes decades later.  We hypothesized that this biological memory is mediated by permanent alterations of the epigenome in stem cell populations.

To better define the cellular machinery associated to this condition, we employed an innovative high-throughput approach based on a whole transcriptomic analysis and classical biomolecular methodologies. more... #> 1056                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Individuals of African descent in the United States suffer disproportionately from diseases with a metabolic etiology (obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes), and from the pathological consequences of these disorders (hypertension and cardiovascular disease).  Using a combination of genetic/genomic and bioinformatics approaches, we identified a large number of genes that were both differentially expressed between American subjects self-identified to be of either African or European ancestry and that also contained single nucleotide polymorphisms that distinguish distantly related ancestral populations. more... #> 1057                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Alcohol affects gene expression in several brain regions. The amygdala is a key structure in the brain’s emotional system and in recent years the crucial importance of the amygdala in drug-seeking and relapse has been increasingly recognized. In this study gene expression screening was used to identify genes involved in alcoholism in the human basolateral amygdala. The results show that alcoholism affects a broad range of genes and many systems including genes involved in synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter transport, structural plasticity, metabolism, energy production, transcription and RNA processing and the circadian cycle. more... #> 1058                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The goal of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles of chronically inflamed human peri-implant and chronically inflamed human periodontal tissues in order to elucidate potential changes at the molecular level. Cells out of the pocket depth of the inflamed peri-implant and periodontal ligament as well as from the middle third of healthy periodontal ligament were applied.

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein, is an acute phase reactant that induces vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) migration and proliferation in areas of vascular injury, and is also upregulated in VSMCs exposed to hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia amplifies the expression of genes induced by TSP-1 in VSMCs. more... #> 1060                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. more... #> 1061                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Pancreatic islet transplantation as a cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) cannot be scaled up due to a scarcity of human pancreas donors.

Using a miRNA microarray platform, we sought to establish differences in miRNA expression in two insulin-target tissues (liver and adipose tissue) from seven-month-old spontaneously diabetic (Goto-Kakizaki [GK]) and non-diabetic (Brown-Norway [BN]) rats. more... #> 1064                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is comprised mainly of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is the cause of 80% of all lung cancer deaths in the US. NSCLC is also associated with a high rate of relapse following clinical treatment and therefore requires robust prognostic markers to better manage therapy options. The aim of this study was to identify miRNA expression profiles in squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) of the lung that would better predict prognosis. #> 1065                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Melioidosis is a severe infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative bacillus classified by the NIAID as a category B priority agent. Septicemia is the most common presentation of the disease with 40% mortality rate even with appropriate treatments. Faster diagnostic procedures are required to improve therapeutic response and survival rates. We have used microarray technology to generate genome-wide transcriptional profiles (>48,000 transcripts) of whole blood obtained from patients with septicemic melioidosis (n=32), patients with sepsis caused by other pathogens (n=31), and uninfected controls (n=29). more... #> 1066                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obesity is becoming increasingly widespread in developed countries, and is often associated with heart diseases and diabetes.  Elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids are a biochemical hallmark of obesity.  Unlike plants and bacteria, mammals cannot utilize fatty acids to generate glucose because of the lack of glyoxylate shunt enzymes. Instead, fatty acids are used for energy storage, and their utilization is regulated at multiple levels ranging from hormonal to metabolic ensuring that glucose is preferentially oxidized before fatty acids. more... #> 1067                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Genes showing differential expression in visceral adipose tissue obtained from Asia Indian obese women suffering from type-2 diabetes mellitus as compared to age and BMI matched normal glucose tolerant women were identified by genome wide transcriptomic profiling in 5 diabetic and 5 control subjects respectively. #> 1068                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hepatic lipid accumulation is an important complication of obesity linked to risk for type 2 diabetes.

Studies have shown that thiazolidinediones (TZD) improve metabolic disturbances in PCOS patients. We hypothesized that the effect of TZD in PCOS is in part mediated by changes in the transcriptional profile of muscle favoring insulin sensitivity.  Using Affymetrix microarrays, we examined the effect of pioglitazone (30 mg/day for 16 weeks) on gene expression in skeletal muscle of 10 obese women with PCOS metabolically characterized by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. more... #> 1075                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Microarray-based studies of skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes and high-risk individuals have demonstrated that insulin resistance and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis co-exist early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes independent of hyperglycaemia and obesity.

Approximately 1/3 of the patients showed substantial changes in expression in genes relevant to innate immunity, apoptosis, and cell signaling. We concluded that periodontal therapy may alter monocytic gene expression in a manner consistent with a systemic anti-inflammatory effect. more... #> 1083                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Although increased vascular stiffness is more prominent in aging males than females, and males are more prone to vascular disease with aging, no study has investigated the genes potentially responsible for gender differences in vascular aging.  We tested the hypothesis that the transcriptional adaptation to aging differs in males and females using a monkey model, which is not only physiologically and phylogenetically closer to humans than the more commonly studied rodent models, but also is not afflicted with the most common forms of vascular disease that accompany the aging process in humans, e.g., atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. more... #> 1084                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Recently, abnormalities in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we hypothesized that decreased expression of OXPHOS genes could be of similar importance for insulin resistance in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 expression array from Affymetrix, we analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from obese women with PCOS (n=16) and age- and body mass index-matched control women (n=13) metabolically characterized by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and indirect calorimetry. more... #> 1085                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This SuperSeries is related to a manuscript published in Genome Biology. The abstract of this manuscript follows here: Background Investigations performed in mice and humans have acknowledged obesity as a low-grade inflammatory disease. Several molecular mechanisms have been convincingly involved in activating inflammatory processes and altering cell composition in white adipose tissue (WAT); however, the overall importance of these alterations, and their long-term impact on the metabolic functions of the WAT and on its morphology, remain unclear. more... #> 1086                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling occurs during tissue repair and inflammation-related pathologies with deposition of specific proteins.  White adipose tissue (WAT) was recently shown to be the site of substantial interstitial fibrosis. ECM components, such as fibronectin, and their receptors integrins control cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Adipocyte differentiation which is under the control of a specific transcriptional network is associated with decrease of fibronectin-rich matrix. more... #> 1087                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that short term exposure (4 hours) to physiologic hyperinsulinemia in normal, healthy subjects without a family history of diabetes would induce a low grade inflammatory response, independently of glycemic status.

A variable infusion of glucose (180 g/l) enriched with tritiated glucose (100 μCi/500 ml) maintained euglycemia during insulin infusion, with monitoring of plasma glucose concentration every 5 to 10 min during the basal and clamp periods using an automated glucose oxidation method (Glucose Analyzer 2, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). more... #> 1092                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Failure of ligamentous support of the genital tract to resist intra-abdominal pressure is a plausible underlying mechanism for the development of pelvic organ prolapse, but the nature of molecular response of pelvic tissue support remains unknown. We hypothesized that the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in maintaining the cellular and extracellular integrity would be altered in cases of pelvic organ prolapse. more... #> 1093                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Preeclampsia complicates more than 3% of all pregnancies in the United States and Europe.

Furthermore, HNF1beta overexpression has been observed in clear cell cancer of the ovary. To identify potential HNF1beta target genes whose activity may be deregulated in human patients we established a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) expressing HNF1beta conditionally. more... #> 1100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Even though autoimmune diseases are heterogeneous, believed to result from the interaction between genetic and environmental components, patients with these disorders exhibit reproducible patterns of gene expression in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A portion of this gene expression profile reflects family resemblance rather than the actual presence of an autoimmune disease.  Here we wanted to identify that portion of this gene expression pattern that is independent of family resemblance and determine if it is a product of disease duration, disease onset, or other factors. more... #> 1101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Summary:   Genetic disorders of muscle cause muscular dystrophy, and are some of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Muscle also rapidly remodels in response to training and innervation. Muscle weakness and wasting is important in such conditions as aging, critical care medicine, space flight, and diabetes. Finally, muscle can also be used to investigate systemic defects, and the compensatory mechansisms invoked by cells to overcome biochemical and genetic abnormalities. more... #> 1102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Expression profile was obtained for GeneChip probe sets among colon cancer specimens with or without the methylation of MLH1 promoter.

When women develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), insulin resistance is more severe and disrupts the intrauterine milieu, resulting in accelerated fetal development with increased risk of macrosomia. As a natural interface between mother and fetus, the placenta is the obligatory target of such environmental changes. more... #> 1104                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Sample tissue: peripheral blood Disease: diabetes Samples for gene expression analysis were obtained before the meal and 1.5 hours after the event.
