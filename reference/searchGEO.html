which can be associated with a specific search field with square brackets.
So, for instance "Homo sapiens\[ORGN\]" denotes a search for `Homo sapiens`
in the “Organism” field. Details see
&lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/qqtutorial.html&gt;. The names and
definitions of these fields can be identified using
[entrez_db_searchable][rentrez::entrez_db_searchable].</p></dd>

    <p>The NCBI allows users to access more records (10 per second) if they register
for and use an API key. [set_entrez_key][rentrez::set_entrez_key] function
allows users to set this key for all calls to rentrez functions during a
particular R session. You can also set an environment variable `ENTREZ_KEY`
by [Sys.setenv][base::Sys.setenv].  Once this value is set to your key
rentrez will use it for all requests to the NCBI. Details see

The mechanisms that generate this ‘unexplained’ phenotypic variation (UPV) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify neuronatin (NNAT) as a conserved factor that buffers against unexplained phenotypic variation. We find that Nnat deficiency in isogenic F1 mice triggers the emergence of a novel, bi-stable polyphenism, where isogenic littermates emerge into adulthood either ‘normal’ or ‘overgrown’, without intermediates. more...</span>

When metformin is combined with chemotherapeutic drugs to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma（HNSCC）, it can effectively enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to define the signaling pathways regulated by metformin in HNSCC, and the underlying mechanisms by which metformin sensitizes HNSCC chemotherapy. more...</span>

Epigenetic alterations are a suspected mechanism. GDM has been associated with placental DNA methylation changes in some epigenome-wide association studies. It remains unclear which genes or pathways are affected, and whether any placental differential gene methylations are correlated to fetal growth or circulating metabolic health biomarkers. more...</span>

However, the progression of insulin resistance into T2D is still poorly understood. This limited understanding is due, in part, to the dearth of suitable models of insulin signaling in human adipocytes. Traditionally, adipocyte models fail to recapitulate in vivo insulin signaling, possibly due to exposure to supraphysiological nutrient and hormone conditions. more...</span>

We performed bulk RNA-seq and compared vehicle to ACE inhibitor, Rosiglitizone, SGLT2 inhibitor, ACEi + Rosiglitizone and ACEi + SGLT2i at two time points (2 days and 2 weeks). To study the mechanism, we also performed bulk RNA-seq on human primary tubular epithelial cells with or without SRSF7 siRNA knockdown.</span>

Methods: Synovial tissue from 46 RA patients was profiled with RNA sequencing before and 12 weeks after treatment with anti-TNF therapies.  Pathway and gene signature analyses were performed on RNA expression profiles of synovial biopsies to identify mechanisms that could discriminate among EULAR good, moderate and non-responders. more...</span>

Additionally, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness promotes human nucleus pulposus cells (hNPCs) senescence. However, the molecular mechanism underlying mechano-induced cellular senescence and IDD progression is not yet fully elucidated. First, we demonstrated that mechano-stress promoted hNPCs senescence via NF-κB signaling. more...</span>

We generated pluripotent stem cells from a patient’s fibroblasts to investigate if gene editing restores endocrine differentiation. Corrected cell lines differentiated into all pancreatic lineages while native cell lines failed to activate pancreatic progenitor and lineage determination genes, suggesting that the mutation disrupts pancreatic organogenesis and results in endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. more...</span>

Both WT and KO β cells were obtained from FACS as positive for both INS and NKX6.1. Single cell RNA-seq results revealed that SLC30A8 is mainly involved in β cell maturation process, and further showed that SLC30A8 LOF accelerates β cell maturation and upregulates insulin secretion pathway in mature β cells.</span>

We recently found that ANRIL abundance in human pancreatic islets was increased in donors carrying certain T2D risk-SNPs, and that a T2D risk-SNP located within exon2 of ANRIL conferred reduced beta cell proliferation index, pointing to a role for ANRIL in the regulation of T2D pathogenicity via an impact on insulin secretory capacity. more...</span>

However, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes with macrovascular complication (DMC) has seldomly been recognized. This study screened lncRNA profiles of leukocytes from DMC patients and explored protective role of lncRNA LYPLAL1-DT in endothelial cells (EC) under high glucose (HG) and inflammatory conditions (IS). more...</span>

We combined human pluripotent stem cell guided differentiation and sequential CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening to uncover regulators of pancreatic specification.

While diabetic symptoms usually resolve after delivery, lasting complications can occur for both mother and child, including fetal overgrowth, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. The rapid progression of GDM is unique to pregnancies, and likely arises from placental dysfunction. more...</span>

We previously identified the small molecule CID661578 as a potent inducer of b-cell regeneration but its target and mechanism of action have remained unknown.

Notably, diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in most countries. Understanding epigenetic contributors to DN can provide novel insights into this complex disorder and lay the foundation for more effective monitoring tools and preventive interventions, critical for achieving the ultimate goal of improving patient care and reducing healthcare burden.</span>

Until now, little is known about the transcriptional profile of human retinal microglia and how they differentiate from peripheral monocytes, as well as from brain microglia. Additionally, the degree to which mice are suitable models for human retinal microglia is still not clear. more...</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 51                             BACKGROUND.  The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) has significantly increased in recent decades and coincides with lifestyle changes that have likely altered the composition of the gut microbiota.  Dysbiosis and gut barrier dysfunction are associated with T1D, and notably, our studies have identified an inflammatory state in T1D families that is consistent microbial antigen exposure.     METHODS.  We conducted a 6-week, single-arm, open-label trial to investigate whether daily multi-strain probiotic (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus) supplementation could reduce the familial inflammatory state in 25 unaffected siblings of diabetes patients.    RESULTS.  Probiotic supplementation was found safe and well-tolerated; there were no adverse events and participant adherence was 93%.  Bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequencing of stool revealed that community alpha and beta diversity were not altered between the pre- and post-supplement samplings.  LEfSe analyses identified post-supplement enrichment of the family Lachnospiraceae, producers of the anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid butyrate.  Systemic inflammation was measured by plasma induced transcription and quantified with a gene ontology-based composite inflammatory index (I.I.com).  After supplementation, I.I.com was reduced (p=0.017), and pathway analysis predicted inhibition of IL17A, lipopolysaccharide, NFkB, IL1B, and TNF (Z-score≤-2.0) and activation of IL10RA (Z-score=2.0).  Post-supplement plasma levels of IL12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2, CCL24 were reduced (p&lt;0.05), while butyrate levels trended 2.4-fold higher (p=0.06).    CONCLUSION.  There is a substantial need for safe, broadly applicable therapies to reduce T1D susceptibility.  This study indicates that investigations of prebiotic and probiotic strategies are warranted as they may be efficacious either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents.</span>

Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the additional effects of nutrient quality on top of energy restriction(ER). Methods: A parallel-designed 12-week 25%ER dietary intervention study was conducted. Participants aged 40-70 years with abdominal obesity were randomized over three groups: a 25%ER high nutrient quality diet (n = 40); a 25%ER low nutrient quality diet (n = 40); or a habitual diet (n = 30). more...</span>

By an unsupervised Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) we identified two RNA aptamers  that specifically recognize mouse and human β cells in vitro and in vivo.  Here we took advantage of commercially available high density protein arrays to identify putative target of the two islet specific aptamers. more...</span>

Current treatment modalities for patients with CRC include surgery, which is often followed with adjuvant chemotherapy, especially in patients with a stage II and III disease. more...</span>

Arg138* variant (R138X) in zinc transporter is associated with a 65% reduced risk for type 2 diabetes. To address the mechanism of how this variant protects from type 2 diabetes, we derived human pluripotent stem cells carrying this mutation and differentiated them into insulin-producing cells. We found that human pluripotent stem cells with R138X mutation and the null mutation have normal efficiency of differentiation towards insulin-producing cells, but these cells were depleted of zinc and presented large diffused insulin granules. more...</span>

Here, we demonstrate that transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived islets into diabetic nonprimates effectively restored endogenous insulin secretion and improved glycemic control. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of S6D2 clusters confirmed the existence of the three major pancreatic endocrine cell populations (β cells, α-like cells and δ-like cells) and their proportions, which altogether accounted for 80%. more...</span>

VAT CD206+CD11c− ATMs were increased in diabetic subjects, scavenger receptor-rich with low intracellular lipids, secreted proinflammatory cytokines, and diverged significantly from two CD11c+ ATM subtypes, which were lipid-laden, lipid antigen presenting, and overlapped with monocyte signatures. more...</span>

Here we show that, among MYC family members, Mycl was expressed preferentially in proliferating immature endocrine cells. Genetic ablation of Mycl caused a modest reduction in cell proliferation of pancreatic endocrine cells in neonatal mice. By contrast, systemic expression of Mycl in mice stimulated proliferation in pancreatic islet cells and resulted in expansion of pancreatic islets without forming tumors in other organs. more...</span>

Ectopic calcification is a typical feature of diabetic vascular disease and resembles an accelerated aging phenotype. We previously found an excess of myeloid calcifying cells (MCCs) in diabetic patients. We herein examined molecular and cellular pathways linking atherosclerotic calcification with calcification by myeloid cells in the diabetic milieu. Methods. We first examined the associations among coronary calcification, MCC levels, and mononuclear cell gene expression in a cross-sectional study of 87 type 2 diabetic patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. more...</span>

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance are poorly understood. Genome-wide association studies for T2DM and other metabolic traits have led to the identification of many candidate SNPs, but the majority of these SNPs are noncoding and determination of associated causal genes and/or specific tissue sites of action have been difficult. more...</span>

This disease is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. In this work, placental samples were collected from GDM and control patients. RNA-seq was performed to identify differences in gene expression. Significantly differentially expressed genes between the GDM and control samples included 64 up-regulated and 296 down-regulated genes. more...</span>

Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are considered to be potent mediators of ECM loss. We reported previously that hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) inducer cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP) could attenuate the ECM breakdown which induced by IL-1β, however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. more...</span>

Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases tuberculosis (TB) severity. We previously reported baseline blood microarray data in a South Indian pulmonary TB cohort with or without DM, finding no qualitative or quantitative differences in immune pathway gene expression. To extend those observations, we compared baseline and longitudinal blood gene expression in TB patients from South India and Brazil. more...</span>

Epigenetic modifications have been implicated to mediate several complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially nephropathy and retinopathy. Our aims were to ascertain if epigenetic alterations in whole blood discriminate among DM patients with normal, delayed and rapid gastric emptying (GE). Methods.  Using ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with next generation sequencing) assays, we compared the genome-wide enrichment of three histone modifications (ie, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in buffy coats from 20 DM patients with normal (n=6), delayed (n=8), or rapid (n=6) GE. more...</span>

Although most patients with T2D are obese, not all obese individuals develop T2D. Thus, an understanding of the mechanistic relationships between obesity and T2D is crucial. In this study, using subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissues (VAT) from obese individuals with or without T2D collected during metabolic surgery, integration of the transcriptomes and methylomes of VAT and SAT with publicly available tissue-specific regulatory networks, we discovered the close relation between T2D and inflammatory response in both SAT and VAT in obese individuals, although less differences were observed respectively in transcriptome or methylome. more...</span>

Several CVB serotypes can establish chronic infection in human cells in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanisms of leading to enterovirus persistency and, possibly, bell-cell autoimmunity are not fully understood. We established a carrier-state persistent infection model in human pancreatic ductal-like cell line PANC-1 using two distinct CVB1 strains and profiled infection-induced changes in cellular transcriptome. more...</span>

In this study we profiled ECFCs from pregnancies of control, overweight and diabetic mothers to study if adverse pregnancies are associated with epigenetic variation in ECFCs.</span>

Unfortunately, little is known about the cellular and molecular processes controlling human trophoblast stem cell maintenance and differentiation into mature trophoblast sub-populations/cell states. To address this, we here report transcriptomic data from n=7 first trimester human placental tissues, n=3 regenerative human trophoblast stem cell (hTSC) derived trophoblast organoids, and n=3 EVT-differentiated hTSC derived organoid cultures at single-cell resolution. more...</span>

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is associated with diabetic arterial media calcification. At the same time, long non-coding RNA(lncRNA) is closely related to the evolution of a variety of cardiovascular diseases, but the involvement of lncRNA in vascular calcification induced by DPP4 has not been reported in details. more...</span>

Patients carrying the mutation develop childhood-onset exocrine pancreas dysfunction followed by the manifestation of diabetes during adulthood. However, it is unclear how CEL mutations cause diabetes. more...</span>

Our randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 trial recently revealed that oral verapamil has short- term beneficial effects in subjects with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) 1. However, what exact biological changes verapamil elicits in humans with T1D, how long they may last, and how to best monitor any associated therapeutic success has remained elusive. more...</span>

We have recently reported that in obese adolescents altered pattern of fat distribution is associated with insulin resistance and T2D. In particular, the high ratio of visceral AT depot (VAT) to abdominal subcutaneous AT depot (SAT) (high VAT/(VAT+SAT)) was associated with a metabolically unhealthy phenotype with high risk for insulin resistance and T2D. more...</span>

There are many studies which suggested the connection between periodontitis and systemic disease, however, the role of specific miRNA as a intersection of periontitis and diabetes are not elucidated. We suggested miR-25-3p as possible common mediator in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and diabetes.</span>

Previous studies have suggested a role for STAT3 in mediating β-cell development and human glucose homeostasis, but little is known about its role in β-cells in obesity. more...</span>

To determine whether lncRNAs are involved in ischemic stroke (IS), we analyzed the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in IS. RNA sequencing was performed on the blood of three pairs of IS patients and heathy controls.

However, the molecular factors that cause this disproportiona increase in CVD in the DM/chronic kidney disease (CKD) population are still unknown.Human endothelial cells treated with high glucose to mimic DM and with the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) to mimic the endothelial injury associated with CKD. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in these conditions were analyzed by RNA sequencing.Lnc-SLC15A1-1 expression was significantly increased upon IS treatment versus high glucose alone.</span>

Transcriptome-wide m6A profiling by next generation sequencing is widely used to explore the distributions as well as quantity of m6A modifications. As traditional m6A-seq demands large amount of starting RNA which limited its application to clinical samples, we present a strategy of low input multi-barcode m6A-seq (SLIM-m6A-seq) to realize simplified m6A profiling of mixed clinical samples. more...</span>

Recent literature challenged the long-standing notion that neonatal diabetes occurs due to ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis. Importantly, mechanisms of β-cell failure during the disease progression and why the other wild-type (WT) INS allele is unable to function still remain unclear. more...</span>

In a murine model of T2D reflecting both hyperinsulinemia induced by high fat diet (HFD) and insulinopenia induced by treatment with streptozotocin (STZ), we examined bone healing in a tibia cortical bone defect. A delayed bone healing was observed during hyperinsulinemia as newly formed bone was reduced by – 28.4±7.7% and was associated with accumulation of marrow adipocytes at the defect site +124.06±38.71%, and increased density of SCA1+ (+74.99± 29.19%) but not Runx2+osteoprogenitor cells. more...</span>

We therefore evaluated whether a decrease in SAT expandability, assessed by measuring SAT lipogenesis (triglyceride production), and an increase in SAT fibrogenesis (collagen production) are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance in people with obesity. more...</span>

We identified 38654 transcripts in pancreatic fat cells. We report that preadipocyte differentiation increased the abundance of mRNA levels of proteins related to adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. These changes in the transcriptome were absent or less pronounced in fat cells obtained from patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. more...</span>

Previous research has identified genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes risk, however gene regulatory changes underlying progression to disease are still largely unknown. We investigated RNA expression changes that occur during diabetes progression using a two-stage approach. In our discovery stage, we compared changes in gene expression using two longitudinally collected blood samples from subjects who transitioned to type 2 diabetes between the time points against those who did not with a novel analytical network approach. more...</span>

In pancreatic islets, overt LD accumulation was detected in humans but not mice. LD buildup in islets was principally observed after roughly 11 years of age, increasing throughout adulthood under physiologic conditions, and also enriched in type 2 diabetes. more...</span>

The molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage dysfunction and its control in diabetes are largely unexplored on an epigenetic level. Here, we report that acetyl histone-H3 (Lys27), an epigenetic mark regulating the macrophage transcriptome, is lost in the hostile tissue microenvironment in diabetes. more...</span>

To define this TF heterogeneity and its consequences for cellular function, we profiled &gt;40,000 cells from normal human islets by scRNA-seq and stratified α and β cells based on combinatorial TF expression. more...</span>

Several consequences of OS including cell recovery and apoptosis have been described previously. In this study, we report systems model of the temporal dynamics of the oxidative stress response in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and characterize HMOX1 as a master regulator in orchestrating the response to oxidative stress. more...</span>

Here we performed high-sensitive ATAC-seq in 9 human liver samples from normal and T2D donors, and identified a set of differentially accessible regions (DARs).

Therefore, a joint microarray analysis of circRNAs and their targeting mRNAs using the peripheral blood of GDM patients and healthy pregnant women was carried out for the first time. In our study, high-throughput microarray sequencing technique was used to analyze the expression profile of circRNA and transcripts mRNA in the peripheral blood of GDM patients, in order to comprehensively evaluate the role of circRNAs targets and their parents genes in the signal pathways related to the pathogenesis of GDM. more...</span>

Disruption of circadian rhythms contributes to Type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis. We elucidated whether altered circadian rhythmicity of clock genes is associated with metabolic dysfunction in T2D. Transcriptional cycling of core clock genes BMAL1, CLOCK, and PER3 was altered in skeletal muscle from individuals with T2D and this was coupled with reduced number and amplitude of cycling genes and disturbed circadian oxygen consumption. more...</span>

The majority of causative variants lie in regulatory elements that are located some distance from their target genes. High resolution chromosome conformation capture (3C) has proven useful for identifying enhancer-promoter interaction. We employed targeted Capture-C at loci with GWAS for severe COVID-19, Type-1 Diabetes (T1D), Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and red blood cell traits (RBC)</span>

Knowledge on underlying mechanisms essential for advanced therapies to attenuate these pathologies is limited. Injection of ABCB5+ stromal precursors (SPs) at the edge of non-healing diabetic wounds in a murine db/db model, closely mirroring human type II diabetes, profoundly accelerates wound closure. Strikingly, enhanced angiogenesis was substantially enforced by the release of the ribonuclease angiogenin from ABCB5+ SPs. more...</span>

To assess the role of hepatic GABA production in obesity-induced metabolic and energy dysregulation, we treated mice with two pharmacologic GABA-T inhibitors and also knocked down hepatic GABA-T expression using an antisense oligonucleotide. more...</span>

The sympathetic nervous system regulates glucagon secretion. To investigate islet sympathetic innervation in T1D, sympathetic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) axons were analyzed in control non-diabetic organ donors, non-diabetic islet autoantibody-positive individuals (AAb), and age-matched persons with T1D. more...</span>

Inflammatory response and immune response were the mostly upregulated biological processes distinguished betwee hND islets and T2DM islets. Results provided insight into the molecular mechanisms in T2DM.</span>

However, how BC influences glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Here we show that BC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) suppress pancreatic endocrine secretion to systemically reset glucose homeostasis. In pancreatic β-cells, miR-122 delivered in BC-derived EVs targets PKM to suppress glycolysis and ATP-dependent insulin exocytosis. more...</span>

The underlying mechanisms that contribute to disease pathogenesis remain largely unknown, partially accounted by the fact that mouse models with heterozygous deletions in Hnf1b do not develop diabetes, in contrast to the phenotypes observed in MODY patients. Here we used a well-controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell pancreatic differentiation model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying HNF1B-associated diabetes and pancreatic hypoplasia. more...</span>

Circulating microRNA (miRNA) are an emerging class of suitable biomarkers for PDAC prognosis. Our aim was to identify whether serum miRNA signatures predict survival of early-stage PDAC. Methods: Se-rum RNA from archival 15 stage I-III PDAC patients and 4 controls was used for miRNAs ex-pression profile (Agilent microarrays). more...</span>

The current standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) is coronary angiography.  Surprisingly, despite well-established clinical indications, up to 40% of the one million invasive cardiac catheterizations return a result of ‘no blockage’.  The present studies employed RNA sequencing of whole blood to identify an RNA signature in patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of CAD. more...</span>

Functional studies showed that DRAIR regulates anti-inflammatory genes and its knockdown enhances proinflammatoory phentype of monocytes. To examine mechanisms of DRAIR actions, we performed Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assays using DRAIR biotinylated tiling oligonucleotides to identify chromatin inding sites in THP-1 monocytes.</span>

Emerging evidence shows that long non coding RNA (lncRNA)s regulate inflammation, but their  role in  T2D induced monocyte dysfunction is unclear. To examine this, we profiled the transcriptome of CD14+ monocytes from volunteers with T2D and without diabetes (n=5 each) using strand-specific RNA-seq on Illumina HiSeq 2500. more...</span>

To model the transcriptional responses of islet cells to DNA damage, we previously developed a human islet culture model in which the DNA damage response and senescence can be induced via double strand-breaks with the agent bleomycin. Here, we report the transcriptome-wide changes in human pancreatic islet cells following bleomycin exposure.</span>

HHcy has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC), and impair endothelial function, a hallmark for vascular injury. However, metabolic processes and molecular mechanisms mediating HHcy-induced endothelial injury remains to be elucidated. more...</span>

Aging is also a primary risk factor for metabolic syndrome (SX), which is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms implicated in sarcopenia and changes in muscle proteome associated with SX in elderly men remain unclear. more...</span>

The previous bulk sequencing of whole tissue  could not show the characteristics of individual cells and the interactions between cells. Here, we select the placental tissues of the gestational diabetes group(GDM), preeclampsia group(PE), advanced age group(GL) and normal control group for single-cell sequencing in order to explain the mechanism of related diseases in more depth.nated spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in the murine hindlimb determines the identity of mesenchymal progenitors and the development of diversity of musculoskeletal tissues they form. more...</span>

The availability of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is an important rate-limiting factor in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis. We conducted a 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of NMN supplementation on metabolic function in 25 postmenopausal women with prediabetes who were overweight/obese. more...</span>

Here, we showdemonstrateed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine cells in autopsy samples derived fromof COVID-19 patients. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining confirmed that multiple types of pancreatic islet cells can be infected byare susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, eliciting a cellular stress response and the induction of chemokines. more...</span>

The enhancer network can be targeted to regulate INK4a/ARF locus in associated pathophysiologies and cancers.</span>

Gene expression profiles of islets isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from resected and snap-frozen pancreas samples were assessed by RNA sequencing.</span>

We have investigated lipolysis and glucose homeostasis in recently diagnosed obese type-2 diabetics; in obese insulin resistant non-diabetic subjects (obese-IR) matched for age, sex, body composition and fasting insulin levels; and in healthy lean individuals. Our results show that obese-IR dissociate lipolysis from glycemic control, revealing that the action of compensatory hyperinsulinemia on blood glucose is not mediated by reduced lipolysis. more...</span>

This limits our understanding of disease-causing regulatory variants. INS promoter mutations cause recessive neonatal diabetes. We studied 60 patients with such mutations, and show that all single base mutations disrupt a CC dinucleotide, while none affect elements important for INS promoter function in episomal assays. more...</span>

Platform to efficiently validate the biological function of variants thus discovered remain distinctly lacking. Here, we used β-like cells derived from isogenic human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), carrying the type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated noncoding SNP rs2542151T&gt;G or the knockout of the SNP-associated gene PTPN2−/−, to systematically examine the role of the T1D associated noncoding variant in β cell function and survival. more...</span>

In this study we used ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to map chromatin accessibility and gene expression from eleven primary human islet samples cultured in vitro with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone at multiple doses and durations. We identified thousands of accessible chromatin sites and genes with significant changes in activity in response to glucocorticoids. more...</span>

Exosomes were isolated from chorionic villi-conditioned media and plasma from normal and GDM pregnancies. A specific set of miRNAs was identified to be selectively enriched within exosomes when compared to their cells of origin indicating specific packaging of miRNAs into exosomes. more...</span>

Aging beta-cells acquire markers of cellular senescence and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can lead to senescence and dysfunction of neighboring cells through paracrine actions, contributing to beta-cell failure. Herein, we defined the beta-cell SASP signature based on unbiased proteomic analysis of conditioned media of cells obtained from human senescent beta-cells. more...</span>

Here, we combined a GWAS of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 520,580 samples with candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood mononuclear cell types defined using single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) of 131,554 nuclei. more...</span>

Specific insights into the role of gender differences and secondary co-morbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancer risk, are yet to be fully obtained. The aim of this study is thus to find a correlation between the transcriptional deregulation present in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients and the risk of cancer, in the presence of T2D, and considering gender differences. more...</span>

Hindered by a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE), patients are managed by symptom-based therapies.  We investigated the duodenal mucosal expression of protein-coding genes and miRNAs in DGE and related these abnormalities to clinical features. Methods. mRNA and micro RNA (miRNA) expression and ultrastructure of duodenal mucosal biopsies were investigated in 39 DGE patients and 21 healthy controls. more...</span>

Hindered by a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE), patients are managed by symptom-based therapies.  We investigated the duodenal mucosal expression of protein-coding genes and miRNAs in DGE and related these abnormalities to clinical features. Methods. mRNA and micro RNA (miRNA) expression and ultrastructure of duodenal mucosal biopsies were investigated in 39 DGE patients and 21 healthy controls. more...</span>

This portion of the kidney is responsible for reabsorption of the filtered glucose, and thus, the amount reabsorbed is not regulated by insulin.  A long-term exposure was designed to model aspects of renal demise seen in diabetes.  We utilized mortal cultures of human renal tubule epithelial cells isolated from renal cortical tissue. more...</span>

The cause of this is unknown. In this study whole islets were extracted with laser capture microdissection from organ donors 1-81 years of age. Increasing age was associated with a downregulation of pathways associated with the cell cycle and increase in markers of senescence e.g. CDKN2A. Among novel genes increasing with age was SPP1.</span>

Changes in hypoglycaemia sensing by the brain contribute to the development of impaired counterregulatory responses to and awareness of hypoglycaemia. Little is known about the intrinsic changes in human astrocytes in response to acute and recurrent low glucose (RLG) exposure.  Methods: Human primary astrocytes (HPA) were exposed to zero, one, three or four bouts of low glucose (0.1 mmol/l) for three hours per day for four days to mimic RH.  On the fourth day, DNA and RNA were collected. Differential gene expression and ontology analyses were performed using DESeq2 and GOseq respectively. DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform.  Results: 24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected (after correction for multiple comparisons). One bout of low glucose exposure had the largest effect on gene expression. Pathway analyses revealed that endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as HSPA5, XBP1, and MANF, involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), were all significantly increased following LG exposure, which was diminished following RLG. There was little correlation between differentially methylated positions and changes in gene expression yet the number of bouts of LG exposure produced distinct methylation signatures.  Conclusions/interpretation: These data suggest that exposure of human astrocytes to transient LG triggers activation of genes involved in the UPR linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Following RLG, the activation of UPR related genes was diminished, suggesting attenuated ER stress. This may be mediated by metabolic adaptations to better preserve intracellular and/or ER ATP levels, but this requires further investigation.</span>

In addition to its contribution to small and large vessel disease, T2D may directly damage cells of the brain neurovascular unit. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic changes in cortical neurones, and associated astrocytes and endothelial cells of the neurovascular unit, in the ageing brain</span>

One potential driver of this enhanced inflammatory state in patients with diabetes is hyperglycemia. Even after blood glucose control is achieved, diabetes-associated complications persist, suggesting the presence of a “hyperglycemic memory.” Innate immune cells, critically involved in various complications associated with diabetes, can build nonspecific, immunological memory (trained immunity) via epigenetic regulation. more...</span>

PF exosomes increase angiogenesis in hypoxic endothelial cells and in animal model of hindlimb ischemia by passing the proangiogenic miRNAs to recipient cells. However, under pathological conditions such as diabetes, exosome cargo composition changes and harmful miRNAs can be transferred to the recipient cells and induce more deleterious effects in target tissues. more...</span>

GLP-1 is classically produced by gut L cells; however, under  certain circumstances alpha-cells can express the prohormone convertase required for  proglucagon processing to GLP-1, prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), and can produce  GLP-1. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs are poorly defined. more...</span>

Transcript expression of laser microdissected cortical interstitium (excluding tubules, glomeruli and large vessels) in 9 human reference nephrectomies was compared to 6 human diabetic kidney biopsy specimens. This transcriptomic data revealed novel interstitial markers and enrichment of relevant pathways. Analysis of diabetic interstitium uncovered genes with unchanged as well as down-regulated expression when compared to reference samples. more...</span>

This phenomenon, termed glycemic memory, has been proposed to occur due to stable programs of cardiac and endothelial cell gene expression. This transcriptional remodeling has been shown to occur in the vascular endothelium through a yet undefined mechanism of cellular reprogramming. more...</span>

Here we demonstrate that estrogen suppletion and insulin resistance in male-to-female transgenders coincides with lower plasma levels of miR-224 and miR-452 carried in extracellular vesicles. Systemic silencing of miR-224 and miR-452 in mice triggered a prediabetic phenotype with higher plasma insulin levels, increased white adipose lipogenesis and less glucose uptake and mitochondrial respiration in brown adipose tissue. more...</span>

During metabolic stress, adipose tissue is more likely to release free fatty acids (FFA) in the serum resulting in an increase of FFA levels not only in blood, but also in follicular fluid (FF). In humans, high concentrations of palmitic acid (PA) and stearic acid (SA) reduced granulosa cell survival and were associated with poor cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) morphology. more...</span>

We assessed whether human β-cell dysfunction induced by metabolic stress is reversible, evaluated the molecular pathways underlying persistent or transient damage, and explored the relationships with T2D islet traits. Twenty-six human islet preparations were exposed to several lipo- and/or glucotoxicity conditions, some of which impaired insulin release depending on stressor type, concentration and combination. more...</span>

We hypothesized that the accumulation of chronically activated T cells in the adipose tissue of HIV+ persons is a central mechanism promoting local macrophage activation, impaired adipocyte function, and the development of HIV-associated glucose intolerance.

Employing a novel deconvolution methodology, we found that during the first trimester, placenta-specific DNA increased prior to the subsequent development of gestational diabetes with no change in patients with preeclampsia while decreasing with maternal obesity. more...</span>

However, different cancers do not respond to metformin with the same effectiveness or acquire resistance. Thus, searching for vulnerabilities of metformin-resistant prostate cancer is a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficiency. A genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 activation library targeting 23430 genes is conducted to identify the genes that confer resistance to metformin in prostate cancer cells.</span>

These diabetes-related complications are suggestive of altered responses of the innate immune system. Recent studies have shown that energy metabolism of monocytes is a crucial determinant of their functionality. Here we investigate whether metabolism and function of monocytes are changed in patients with diabetes and aim to identify diabetes-associated factors driving these alterations. more...</span>

However, the prevalence, plasticity and functional consequences of this cellular state remain unknown.  We employed single-cell RNAseq to detail the maturation program of alpha and beta cells during human ontogeny. We show that although both alpha and beta cells mature in part by repressing non-endocrine genes, alpha-cells retain hallmarks of an immature state, while beta-cells attain a full beta-cell specific gene expression program. more...</span>

In particular class IIa HDACs have been shown to affect hepatic gluconeogenesis and previous approaches revealed that their inhibition reduces blood glucose in type 2 diabetic mice. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of class IIa HDAC inhibition as a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of metabolic diseases. more...</span>

We therefore investigated the influence of these cytokines on phenotype and function of immune cells that are involved in disease progression. To understand how IL-12 and IL-18 may synergize to impair Treg function and phenotype, we conducted transcriptional profiling of Treg expanded under normal conditions or in the presence of IL-12 and IL-18. more...</span>

Earlier studies from our group have shown that the glomerular podocytes, which play an essential role in renal filtration, express the growth hormone receptor, suggesting the direct action of growth hormone on these cells. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism and the downstream pathways that are induced by the excess growth hormone in these podocytes leading to diabetic nephropathy are not clearly established. more...</span>

Voclosporin (VCS), a next generation calcineurin inhibitor is reported to cause fewer incidences of NODAT but the reason is unclear. Whilst calcineurin signaling plays important roles in pancreatic beta-cell survival, proliferation, and function, its effects on human beta-cells remain understudied. more...</span>

Regulatory macrophages (Mreg) are a distinct macrophage type, partially sharing some functionalities with both M1 and M2 cells. Mreg possess immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic properties, and are considered as a potential allogeneic cell therapy product to treat clinical conditions, e.g., non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. more...</span>

Although cold is a potent activator of brown adipose tissue, the increase in peripheral insulin sensitivity by cold is largely mediated by events occurring in skeletal muscle and at least partly involves GLUT4 translocation, as is also observed for exercise training. more...</span>

Here, we test whether environmental stress can induce cellular dysfunction through modulating RNA-chromatin interactions. We induce endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction with high glucose and TNFα (H + T), that mimic the common stress in diabetes mellitus. We characterize the H + T-induced changes in gene expression by single cell (sc)RNA-seq, DNA interactions by Hi-C, and RNA-chromatin interactions by iMARGI. more...</span>

In vitro exposure of β-cells to the saturated free fatty acid palmitate is a valuable model of lipotoxicity, reproducing features of β-cell failure observed in type 2 diabetes. In order to map the β-cell response to lipotoxicity, we combined RNA-sequencing of palmitate-treated human islets with iTRAQ proteomics of insulin-secreting INS-1E cells following a time course exposure to palmitate. more...</span>

However, given the variability of CpG methylation in the INS gene in different cell types, this gene alone may not yield sufficiently specific information to unambiguously report β-cell damage. We employed an unbiased approach using data from a human DNA methylation gene array to identify the CHTOP gene as a candidate biomarker whose CpGs show a greater frequency of unmethylation in human islets. more...</span>

We herein evaluated the role of rs290487 variant in hepatic glucose homeostasis by integrating clinical and multi-omics data (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and metabolomics) from CRISPR/Cas9 edited PLC-PRF-5 cell lines (C/C vs. C/T). In clinical cohort, C/C genotype was associated with higher insulin resistance index and higher incidence of hepatogenous diabetes as compared to C/T heterozygote and T/T homozygote genotypes. more...</span>

However, lncRNA regulation of mitochondrial fission in podocytes is poorly understood. Here, we want to identify how lncRNA changes in human podocytes cultured with high glucose.</span>

Still, no therapies that target these underlying processes are available. We therefore performed high-throughput screening of 300,000 compounds and extensive medicinal chemistry optimization and here report the discovery of SRI-37330, an orally bioavailable, non-toxic small molecule, which effectively rescued mice from streptozotocin- and obesity-induced (db/db) diabetes. more...</span>

While much insight into brown fat biology has been gained from murine cell lines and models, few resources are available to study human brown fat in-vitro. In this study, we detail the derivation and characterization of a novel human ES UCP1 reporter cell line that marks UCP1 positive adipocytes in-vitro. more...</span>

We experienced a rare case with chronic hepatitis C, in which multiple liver tumors at different stages in multistep hepatocarcinogenesis were observed at the same time. Under the same genetic and etiological backgrounds, comparisons of expression profiles among dysplastic nodules (DN), well differentiated HCC (WEL), and moderately differentiated HCC (MOD) would provide critical genetic information for the initiation and progression of HCC.</span>

Despite its wide application in the treatment of multiple health conditions, the glycemic response to metformin is highly variable, emphasizing the need for reliable biomarkers.   We chose the RNA-Seq-based comparative transcriptomics approach to evaluate the systemic effect of metformin and highlight potential predictive biomarkers of metformin response in drug-naïve type 2 diabetes patient volunteers in vivo. more...</span>

Here we present a multi-omics approach allowing the simultaneous targeted quantification of mRNA and protein expression in single-cells and investigate its performance to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations. more...</span>

Obesity and associated insulin resistance are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation driven by the cooperation of the innate immune system and dysregulated metabolism in adipose tissue and other metabolic organs. RIPK1 (Receptor-Interacting serine/threonine Protein Kinase 1) is a central regulator of inflammatory cell function that coordinates inflammation, apoptosis and necroptosis in response to inflammatory stimuli. more...</span>

Islet viability in the subcutaneous space represents an unfulfilled paradigm that is crucial to ensure widespread adoption and safety of clinical islet transplantation. Herein we report that human islets transplanted subcutaneously uniformly promote long-term euglycemia when admixed with a device-free Islet Viability Matrix (IVM), through a previously unknown anti-apoptotic mechanism.</span>

Although susceptibility to CVD is different for every patient, why some patients with T2DM develop CVD while others are protected has not yet been clarified. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been utilized to reveal the influence of genotype on phenotype and have the potential to connect a clinical phenotype to a causal gene. more...</span>

Here, we show that human thermogenic adipocytes specifically express a primate-specific long non-coding RNA, LINC00473 which is highly correlated with UCP1 expression and decreased in obesity and type-2 diabetes. LINC00473 is detected in progenitor cells, and increases upon differentiation and in response to cAMP. more...</span>

Smoking behaviors, including age at smoking initiation (ASI), smoking dependence (SD), and smoking cessation (SC), are all complex phenotypes determined by both genetic and environmental factors as well as their interactions. To identify susceptibility loci for each smoking phenotype, numerous studies have been conducted, with approaches including genome-wide linkage scans, candidate gene-based association analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS). more...</span>

We presently characterized human beta cell responses to IFNa by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial beta cell response to IFNa was characterized by major chromatin remodeling, followed by marked changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFNa-induced changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage increased the diversity of transcripts expressed by beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may significantly expand the peptide repertoire presented by beta cells to the immune system. On the other hand, beta cells up-regulated checkpoint proteins, such as PDL1 and HLA-E, that may protect them against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis led to the identification of two compound classes that revert IFNa effects on human beta cells and may be translated to clinical trials.</span>

We presently characterized human beta cell responses to IFNa by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial beta cell response to IFNa was characterized by major chromatin remodeling, followed by marked changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFNa-induced changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage increased the diversity of transcripts expressed by beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may significantly expand the peptide repertoire presented by beta cells to the immune system. On the other hand, beta cells up-regulated checkpoint proteins, such as PDL1 and HLA-E, that may protect them against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis led to the identification of two compound classes that revert IFNa effects on human beta cells and may be translated to clinical trials.</span>

At the molecular level, insulin exerts its function  through the insulin receptor (IR), a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Data from  human genetic studies have shown that Grb14 functions as a negative modulator of IR  activity, and germline Grb14-knockout (KO) mice have improved insulin signaling in liver  and muscle tissues. more...</span>

Smoking behaviors, including age at smoking initiation (ASI), smoking dependence (SD), and smoking cessation (SC), are all complex phenotypes determined by both genetic and environmental factors as well as their interactions. To identify susceptibility loci for each smoking phenotype, numerous studies have been conducted, with approaches including genome-wide linkage scans, candidate gene-based association analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS). more...</span>

To investigate the long-lived nature of these cells, we established a DNA methylation-based T cell “multipotency index” and found that beta cell-specific CD8+ T-cells retained a stem-like epigenetic multipotency score. Single cell ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the co-existence of naive and effector-associated epigenetic programs in individual beta cell-specific CD8+ T-cells. more...</span>

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-B signaling in endothelial cells promotes uptake and transcytosis of fatty acids (FA) from the bloodstream to the underlying tissue, advancing pathological lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in diabetic complications. Here we demonstrate a VEGF-B dependent obstruction of endothelial glucose transport attributed to plasma membrane lipid alterations affecting glucose transporter 1 function, which was independent of FA uptake. more...</span>

However, scientific endeavors to harness the regenerative potential of ASC’s for regenerative medicine are currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that determine cell-lineage commitment and stemness. In the current study, we used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis to identify epigenetic gene targets and cellular processes that are responsive to 5-azathioprine, a potent inducer of DNA methylation. more...</span>

Although most effort has focused on generating pancreatic beta cells, there is considerable evidence that glucagon secreting alpha cells are critically involved in disease progression and proper glucose control. Here we report on the generation of stem cell-derived human pancreatic alpha (SC-alpha) cells from pluripotent stem cells via a transient pre-alpha cell intermediate. more...</span>

We determined differential response in gene expression to high glucose in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from matched type 1 diabetic individuals with and without retinopathy. Those genes exhibiting the largest difference in glucose response between diabetic subjects with and without retinopathy were assessed for association to diabetic retinopathy utilizing genotype data from a meta-genome-wide association study. more...</span>

Conversely, establishing limitations in proliferative potential may be important to achieve functional maturity as well as to prevent abnormal growths after transplantation of stem cell derived products.

Here we combined the generation of single cell derived clonal cultures from human adult kidney with transcriptomic analysis for molecular characterization of in-vitro clonal behavior at inception and after propagation. We discovered two types of clones; rapidly proliferating de-differentiated fibroblast-like (FL) originating from the proximal tubule and stably proliferating cuboidal epithelial-like (EL) originating from distal segments that efficiently propagate with one cell giving rise to 3.3*10(6) cells. more...</span>

Using a genome-wide methylation assay, we identified sex-dependent dysregulation of the methylome of CD3+ T-lymphocytes, a cell type that plays an important role in obesity and inflammatory diseases, in newborn offspring of overweight and obese mothers. more...</span>

Peripheral blood samples were collected in tempus tubes from a healthy control subject with no family history of autoimmunity (n=1) and from subjects with Type 1 diabetes (n=4). Total RNA was isolated independently from 3 replicate aliquots of the same tempus samples and then globin-reduced. RNAseq libraries were prepared from the globin-reduced RNA.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 384  BACKGROUND: Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D), such as macrovascular and microvascular events, are the major causes for T2D-related disability and mortality. A clinically convenient, non-invasive approach for monitoring the development of these complications would improve the overall life quality of patients with T2D and help reduce healthcare burden through preventive interventions.  METHODS: A selective chemical labeling strategy for 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC-Seal) was used to profile genome-wide 5hmCs, an emerging class of epigenetic markers implicated in complex diseases including diabetes, in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from a collection of Chinese patients (n = 62). Differentially modified 5hmC markers between patients with T2D with and without macrovascular/microvascular complications were analyzed under a case-control design.  RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in 5hmC markers were associated with T2D-related macrovascular/microvascular complications, involving genes and pathways relevant to vascular biology and diabetes, including insulin resistance and inflammation. A 16-gene 5hmC marker panel accurately distinguished patients with vascular complications from those without (testing set: AUC = 0.85, 95%CI, 0.73-0.96), outperforming conventional clinical variables such as urinary albumin. In addition, a separate 13-gene 5hmC marker panel could distinguish patients with single complications from those with multiple complications (testing set: AUC = 0.84, 95%CI, 0.68-0.99), showing superiority over conventional clinical variables.  CONCLUSIONS: The 5hmC markers in cfDNA reflected the epigenetic changes in patients with T2D who developed macrovascular/microvascular complications. The 5hmC-Seal assay has the potential to be a clinically convenient, non-invasive approach that can be applied in the clinic to monitor the presence and severity of diabetic vascular complications.</span>

We perfomed RNA-seq on native veins and AVFs with different maturation outcomes (matured vs. failed). The "matured" and "failed" subgroups were similar in terms of demographics (age range, sex distribution, ethnicity distribution), clinical characteristics (proportion of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, previous hemodialysis access history), and time interval between first-stage and second-stage surgeries. more...</span>

So far the knowledge on underlying mechanisms and thereon based therapeutic options to attenuate these pathologies are limited. Here we systematically administered ABCB5+ MSCs for the treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic wounds employing db/db mice, a type II diabetes model as their number markedly declined during diabetes. more...</span>

The common endpoint for all ex vivo strategies is transplantation into diabetic patients. However, the effects of hyperglycemia environment on the transplanted cells were not yet properly assessed. Thus, the main goal of this study was to characterize global effect of brief and prolonged in vivo hyperglycemia exposure on the cell fate acquisition and maintenance of transplanted human pancreatic progenitors. more...</span>

In the most severely pathological muscle samples, regeneration appears to be stymied and our data suggest that this may be partly due to intrinsic dysfunction of the satellite cell pool in addition to extrinsic structural pathology (e.g. nerve damage).</span>

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regional fat storage remain poorly characterized, preventing therapeutic innovation. We here applied a systematic genome-wide screen and translational approach, where human primary preadipocytes were isolated from liposuction aspirate and differentiated. more...</span>

Here, we firstly verified PTPRN expression was negatively correlated with overall survival of glioblastoma patients. Moreover, suppression of PTPRN expression reduced both U87 and U343 cell viability, suppressed proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited glioma growth in vivo. more...</span>

We find that MG132 treatment results in the spreading of the H3-trimethyl lysine 4 mark into gene bodies of a subset of induced genes in MCF-7 cells. The spreading of the H3K4me3 is concomitant with hyperacetylation (H3K27ac, K122ac and K9/14ac) of the corresponding gene TSS. more...</span>

Sphingomyelin is an abundant component of cell membranes. Sphingomyelinases generate ceramide from sphingomyelin as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. While the role of acid sphingomyelinase is well established, the role of neutral sphingomyelinases in human neurodevelopment has remained elusive. more...</span>

Progressive loss of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) are associated with the onset of IDD. Cell-based therapy has been shown the promising for many diseases, including the IDD in preclinical studies. However, the limited availability of human NPCs has hurdled such application for IDD. This study aimed to define strategies to derive NPCs from human ESC/iPSC. more...</span>

Transplantation of NPCs, derived from human pluripotent stem cells including hESC/iPSCs, may offer a novel therapy for IDD. To date, effective in vitro differentiations of notochordal and NP cells remained to be demonstrated. Towards this end, we developed a three-step protocol to directly differentiate hESC/iPSC towards mesodermal, then notochordal and finally NPCs. more...</span>

We sought the significance of PAX8 expression in mouse and human islet biology. PAX8 was induced in gestating mouse islets and in human islets treated with recombinant prolactin. Global gene expression profiling of human and mouse islets overexpressing the corresponding species-specific PAX8 revealed the modulation of distinct genetic pathways that converge on cell survival. more...</span>

Diabetes often leads to the dysregulation of angiogenesis, although, the mechanism is not fully understood. Previously, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to modulate angiogenesis.

Here we report that an unexpectedly high fraction of lncRNAs, but not protein-coding mRNAs, is repressed during diet-induced obesity (DIO) and refeeding, whilst nutrient deprivation specifically induced lncRNAs in mouse liver. Similarly, lncRNAs were lost in diabetic humans. more...</span>

A set of genes that were upregulated at early but downregulated in late DN were shown to be largely renoprotective, which included genes in the retinoic acid pathway and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor. more...</span>

It is known, that the central component of CAD pathogenesis is a chronic vascular inflammation. However, the mechanisms underlying the changes that occur in T, B and NK-lymphocytes, monocytes and other immune cells during CAD and MI are still poorly understood. more...</span>

Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a complex metabolic process that may result in glucose generation from certain non-carbohydrate substrates. Chinese herbal medicine astragalus polysaccharides and berberine have been documented to ameliorate IR, and combined use of astragalus polysaccharide (AP) and berberine (BBR) are reported to synergistically produce an even better effect. more...</span>

Although evidence indicates that miRNAs have roles in pancreas development and endocrine cell function, the role of miRNAs in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation has not been systematically explored. To address this, we performed genome-wide small RNA sequencing analysis in pancreatic progenitor cells differentiated in vitro from human embryonic stem cells and endocrine cells isolated from whole human islets. more...</span>

We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify these depot-specific differences in the stromal vascular fraction of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue of obese individuals. We characterized multiple immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipose and hematopoietic stem cell progenitors. more...</span>

Currently, it is unclear whether advanced donor age and commonly associated comorbidities affect the properties of ex vivo-expanded BMSCs. Thus, we stratified cells from adult and elderly donors from our biobank (n = 10 and n = 13, mean age 38 and 72 years, respectively) and compared their phenotypic and functional performance, using multiple assays typically employed as minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).We found that BMSCs from both cohorts meet the standard criteria for MSC, exhibiting similar morphology, growth kinetics, gene expression profiles, and pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive potential and the capacity to differentiate toward adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages.We found no substantial differences between cells from the adult and elderly cohorts. more...</span>

To examine the signaling pathways regulating islet cell function, we subjected protein lysates of whole islets from control and IFT88 knockout mice to a commercial signaling-protein array analysis (Full Moon Bio, Inc).

T1D subjects were recently shown to harbor distinct intestinal microbiome profiles. Based on these findings, the role of gut bacteria in T1D is being intensively investigated. The mechanism connecting intestinal microbial homeostasis with the development of T1D is unknown.  Specific gut bacteria such as Bacteroides dorei (BD) and Ruminococcus gnavus (RG) show markedly increased abundance prior to the development of autoimmunity. more...</span>

Here, we integrate genome-wide assessments of DNA methylation with corresponding gene expression profiles and sequence variation to show that relative to NESAM, acute ESAM is characterized by significant hypomethylation at 99% of differentially methylated loci in two SAM cohorts, whereas recovered adults show no significant differences in methylation. more...</span>

Appropriate depth is critical. Shallow invasion increases the risk of pregnancy complications, e.g., severe preeclampsia. Overly deep invasion, the hallmark of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), increases the risk of pre-term delivery, hemorrhage and death. more...</span>

Normoandrogen (NA) and Hyperandrogen (HA) PCOS are distinguished under distinct level of testosterone, while markers and expression patterns for both subtypes were not adequately studied. Text-mining analysis stated the correlation for PCOS with granusola cells and thus we performed microarray analysis on granusola cells from HA PCOS, NA PCOS and normal tissue from individuals, and afterwards downloaded RNA-seq and microarray data from NCBI GEO database on granusola cells from PCOS and normal ovary. more...</span>

Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of action, underlying the various therapeutic effects of metformin, remain elusive. The goal of this study was to evaluate the alterations in longitudinal whole-blood transcriptome profiles of healthy individuals after a one-week metformin intervention in order to identify the novel molecular targets and further prompt the discovery of predictive biomarkers of metformin response. more...</span>

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying training-induced fitness in combination with personal life-style remain largely unexplored. Circulating biomarkers such as microRNAs (miRNAs) offer themselves for studying systemic and cellular changes since they can be collected from the bloodstream in a low-invasive manner. more...</span>

Because of its extreme heterogeneity in clinical and genetic presentation, the relationship between transcriptome and the clinical phenotype and the associated co-morbidities seen in KS has not been fully clarified yet. We reported here a 47 XXY karyotype Chinese male (KS) with infertility and analyzed the differences in gene expression patterns of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a Chinese male and a female control with normal karyotype by single-cell sequencing. more...</span>

DNA methylation profiles of mothers showed high similarity across groups, while on the contrary, newborns from GDM mothers showed a marked distinct epigenetic profile compared to newborns of both lean and obese mothers. more...</span>

DN can be differentially diagnosed only through histological investigation. Therefore, there is need for molecular biomarkers, such as miRNAs, to discriminate among different histological lesions in diabetics. Aim of this study was to identify a pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs in kidney biopsies of DN patients and to assess their potential as differential diagnostic biomarkers. more...</span>

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in SC-β cells is variable in vitro but stabilizes after transplantation and maturation under the kidney capsule of mice. We identified mechanisms correlated with functional maturation using RNA-sequencing and co-expression network analysis. more...</span>

For this purpose, a microarray was performed to study the gene expression profile of macrophages cultivated in a high glucose concentration. more...</span>

To investigate the dual phenotype of DEs at single cell resolution, we examined their transcriptomes using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We sorted individual DEs, Bcon and Tcon cells from PBMCs of one type I diabetes patient and analyzed the transcriptomes  of 34 DEs,  20 Bcon , and 23 Tcon  using the plate-based SMART-seq2 protocol (Tirosh and Suva, 2018; Tirosh et al., 2016). more...</span>

Here we demonstrate a reproducible method with minimal artifacts for single-nucleus Droplet-based RNA sequencing (snDrop-Seq) that we use to resolve thirty distinct cell populations in human adult kidney. We define molecular transition states along more than ten nephron segments spanning two major kidney regions. more...</span>

As a step towards mastery of this process, we report on transcriptional profiling of &gt;100,000 individual cells sampled during in vitro beta cell differentiation and describe the cells that emerge. We resolve populations corresponding to beta cells, alpha-like poly-hormonal cells, non-endocrine cells that resemble pancreatic exocrine cells and a previously unreported population resembling enterochromaffin cells. more...</span>

Using FACS analysis, gene expression profiling and metabolic and proteomic analyses, we identified three APCs subtypes in human white adipose tissues. The APC subtypes are molecularly distinct but possess similar proliferative and adipogenic capacities. more...</span>

Neonatal adiposity is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Investigating contributors to neonata adiposity is important for understanding early life obesity risk. Epigenetic changes of metabolic genes in cord blood may contribute to excessive neonatal adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity. more...</span>

It is well established that obesity negatively alters immune cell frequencies and functions. Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of innate T cells, which we have previously reported are dysregulated in obesity, with altered circulating and adipose tissue frequencies and a reduction in their IFN-gamma production, which is a critical effector function of MAIT cells in host defence. more...</span>

Here we report that SMPDL3b excess, as observed in podocytes in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), impairs insulin receptor isoform B-dependent pro-survival insulin signaling by interfering with insulin receptor isoforms binding to caveolin-1 in PM. SMPDL3b excess affects the production of active sphingolipids resulting in decreased ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) content as observed in human podocytes in vitro and in kidney cortexes of diabetic db/db mice in vivo. more...</span>

We generated human pancreatic stem cell-derived endocrine cells with mutations in HNF1A and show that HNF1A deficiency impairs scβ-cell fate, insulin granule maturation and the secretion of insulin in a glucose responsive manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that HNF1A orchestrates a network of genes involved in glucose metabolism, zinc transport, calcium ion binding and hormone exocytosis. more...</span>

Despite the epidemiological importance of WAT there is a paucity of translational models to study long term changes in mature adipocytes. Here, we describe a novel method for the culture of mature white adipocytes under a permeable membrane. Compared to existing culture methods such as adipose tissue explants and adipocyte ceiling culture, Membrane mature Adipocyte Aggregate Cultures (MAAC) are superior at maintaining adipogenic gene expression through 2 weeks of culture, do not dedifferentiate, and are under reduced hypoxic stress relative to adipose tissue explants. more...</span>

Extracellular small non-coding RNAs (exRNAs) have been associated with cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and we hypothesized that they are associated with post-MI LVRm phenotypes. RNA sequencing of exRNAs was performed on plasma samples from patients with “beneficial” (decrease LVESVI ≥20%, n=11) and “adverse” (increase LVESVI ≥15%, n=11) LVRm. more...</span>

We performed epigenomic profiling of two enhancer marks, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, using primary TH1 and TREG cells from healthy  and T1D subjects. By integrating enhancers predicted using these ChIP-Seq data, T1D associated SNPs and additional supporting data, we found and validated several novel risk SNPs for T1D.</span>

We used RNA microarray (Agilent 8 X 60 K), medical records, and questionnaire data from 183 mother-newborn pairs from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort study (Flanders, Belgium). We applied a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified genes modules and hub genes that were associated with maternal BMI as well as newborn birth weight. more...</span>

We generated human pancreatic stem cell-derived endocrine cells with mutations in HNF1A and show that HNF1A deficiency impairs scβ-cell fate, insulin granule maturation and the secretion of insulin in a glucose responsive manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that HNF1A orchestrates a network of genes involved in glucose metabolism, zinc transport, calcium ion binding and hormone exocytosis. more...</span>

Mounting evidence supports a central role for β-cell alterations in triggering the activation of self-reactive T-cells in T1D. However, the early deleterious events that occur in β cells, underpinning islet autoimmunity are not known. We hypothesized that epigenetic modifications induced in β cells by inflammatory mediators play a key role in initiating the autoimmune response. more...</span>

Moreover, abnormal syncytial fusion seems to be implicated in the development of many complications including pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). However, little is known about the mechanisms that control cytotrophoblast fusion into syncytiotrophoblast. more...</span>

To gain functional understanding of AMD genetics, we generated transcriptional profiles of retina from 453 individuals including both controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD.  We integrated retinal transcriptomes, covering 13,662 protein-coding and 1,462 noncoding genes, with genotypes at over 9 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of a tissue not included in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and other large datasets. more...</span>

Preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication involving oxidative stress in the placenta, has been associated with long-term health implications for the child, including an increased risk of developing schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders in later life. We have shown previously, in a rodent model of placental oxidative stress, that culture medium conditioned by the placenta alters neuronal characteristics when applied to primary cortical cultures in vitro and mimics many of the neurodevelopmental changes observed in the offspring brain. more...</span>

However, the effect of metformin on gene expression in endothelial cells remains unknown. We used RNA-seq to profile gene expression in primary human aortic endothelial cells stimulated with metformin in normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic conditions. We identified novel pathways in hyperglycaemic endothelial cells that may be involved in the development of endothelial dysfunction. more...</span>

Although the mechanisms underlying the fetal origin of metabolic disease are poorly understood, evidence suggests epigenomic alterations play a critical role. We sought to identify changes in DNA methylation patterns that define IUGR in CD3+ T-cells purified from umbilical cord blood obtained from appropriate for gestational age (Control) and IUGR male newborns using a genome-wide assay. more...</span>

Here, using human adipose stem cell-derived adipocytes, we demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were enriched at sites of patient-specific PPARg binding, which correlated with the individual-specific effects of TZD rosiglitazone (rosi) on gene expression. more...</span>

Comprehensive knowledge of its molecular landscape is lacking, yet required, for effective use of this model. Here, we report chromosomal (spectral karyotyping), genetic (genotyping), epigenomic (ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq), chromatin interaction (Hi-C and Pol2 ChIA-PET), and transcriptomic (RNA-seq and miRNA-seq) maps of EndoC-βH1. more...</span>

Insulin analogues have been developed to achieve further improvement in the therapy of diabetes. However, modifications introduced into the insulin molecule might enhance their affinity to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R). Most tumors, including endometrial cancers, express high levels of IGF1R. The present study was aimed at identifying the entire set of genes that are differentially activated by insulin glargine or detemir, in comparison to regular insulin and IGF1, in Type 1 and Type 2 endometrial cancer cell lines (ECC-1 and USPC-1, respectively). more...</span>

In addition, it is well-known that maternal obesity (MO) increases risk of offspring cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and obesity. However, the mechanisms by which the MO intrauterine environment predisposes offspring to CVD and metabolic dysregulation are unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of MO on primate fetal liver and identify underlying molecular mechanisms by which MO increases disease risk. more...</span>

Although fat deposition at distinct anatomical sites is influenced by genetic factors their functional mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show ENPP6 as a neural determinant of selectively visceral adiposity. Through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body composition analysis in 1,301 individuals from the isolated population of Orkney, we identified low-frequency variants at 4q35.1 associated with a reduction of DXA fat distribution (rs144607341/rs17583822, P = 2.7 x 10-10/ 2.0 x 10-9). more...</span>

A greater understanding of how β-cells form during embryonic development will improve current hESC differentiation protocols. As β-cells are formed from NEUROG3-expressing endocrine progenitors, this study focused on characterizing the single-cell transcriptomes of mouse and hESC-derived endocrine progenitors. more...</span>

Among the potential alternatives, the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESc) into insulin-producing β-cells has taken an early lead. However, while the proportion of β-cells obtained through current methods is relatively high, a significant percentage of undefined non-endocrine cell types are still generated. more...</span>

Here we present evidence from miRNA microarray analyses of clinical data sets along with in vitro and in vivo experiments that miR-141 is a key regulator of IDD. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show that miR-141 drives IDD by inducing nucleus pulposus (NP) apoptosis. more...</span>

This unique mode of gene expression is dependent on allele-specific DNA methylation profiles established at regulatory sequences called imprinting control regions. These loci are frequently used as biosensors to study how environmental exposures affect methylation and transcription. However, a critical unanswered question is whether they are more, less or equally sensitive to environmental stressors as the rest of the genome. more...</span>

They can lead to proinsulin misfolding and its retention in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This results in increased ER-stress suggested to trigger beta-cell apoptosis. In humans, the mechanisms underlying beta-cell failure remain unclear. Here we show that misfolded proinsulin impairs developing beta-cell proliferation without increasing apoptosis. more...</span>

While senescent cells often manifest an array of senescence-associated phenotypes, such as cell cycle arrest, altered heterochromatin architecture, reprogrammed metabolism and senescence-associated secretory phenotype(SASP), the identification of senescence cells has been hindered by lack of specific and universal biomarkers. more...</span>

Extracellular vesicles (EVs; exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies) are small (50-400 nM) lipid-bound vesicles capable of shuttling functional proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids as part of intercellular communication systems. Recent studies in mouse models and in cell culture suggest that EVs may modulate insulin signaling. more...</span>

IL-21 and IL-15 are implicated in the pathogenesis of type-1 diabetes, graft-versus-host disease, and celiac disease (CeD), a gluten-mediated autoimmune-like enteropathy. Attempts to treat type-1 diabetes and graft-versus-host disease with biologics targeting one particular cytokine have failed. more...</span>

With these unexpected findings for T1D, we sequenced the donor DNA and found a pathogenic heterozygous variant in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A). more...</span>

Here we used a massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq technology (Drop-Seq) to analyze the transcriptome of 26,677 pancreatic islets cells from both healthy and type II diabetic (T2D) donors. We have analyzed cell type-specific gene signatures, and detected several rare α or β cell subpopulations with high sensitivity. more...</span>

Here we introduce a biomarker – ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-3 (NTPDase3) – that is expressed on the cell surface of essentially all adult human β-cells, including those from individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D). NTPDase3 is expressed dynamically during postnatal human pancreas development, appearing first in acinar cells at birth, but several months later its expression declines in acinar cells while concurrently emerges in islet β-cells. more...</span>

Whereas mechanisms of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in FFA-treated beta-cells have been intensively studied, biological events preceding the secretory failure, when GSIS is accentuated, are poorly investigated. more...</span>

Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to specifically isolate macrophage enriched regions from human carotid atherosclerotic plaque samples. RNA isolated was then sent for sequencing using the Illumina bead array system. Gene expression data revealed that 106 genes from diabetic macrophages are differentially expressed (FDR&lt;0.2) and provide mechanistic evidence for the involvement of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in the development of diabetic atherosclerosis.</span>

Here we investigated insulin sensitivity and muscle metabolism in fourteen healthy young lean men (age 22.4 ± 2.8 years; BMI 22.3 ± 2.1 kg/m2 [mean ± SD]) after a 3-day control protocol and a 3.5-day misalignment protocol induced by a 12-h rapid shift of the behavioral cycle. more...</span>

JCAD has been identified as a novel component of endothelial cell-cell junctions (Akashi et al., 2011, BBRC) and regulates angiogenesis (Hara et al, ATVB, 2017). In our study, we observed that JCAD is a 148-KDa protein identified by mass spectrometry, but display a band shift to around 180-200 KDa, suggesting that JCAD is subject to multiple post-translatinonal modification. more...</span>

However, their target epitopes have not been demonstrated to be naturally processed and presented by β cells. We therefore performed an epitope discovery study combining HLA Class I peptidomics and transcriptomics strategies. Inflammatory cytokines increased β-cell peptide presentation in vitro, paralleling upregulation of HLA Class I expression. more...</span>

Of concern, therapeutic interventions shown to significantly dampen or even reverse disease in mouse models have not successfully translated into interventions in human T1D. The present study addresses this disconnect in research translation by directly analyzing human donor islets from individuals with T1D, aiming to provide insight into disease mechanisms and identify potential target pathways for therapeutic intervention. more...</span>

We have developed a sensitive array-based bioassay whereby patient plasma is used to induce transcription in healthy “reporter” leukocytes.  Here we report a refined gene ontology-based inflammatory index (I.I.359) that is based upon expression levels of 359 transcripts identified in cross-sectional studies of new onset Type 1 diabetes patients and controls, where higher scores reflect greater inflammatory bias. more...</span>

It is known that diabetes is associated with an elevated risk of cancer, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In particular, it remains unclear as to how hyperglycemia may affect epigenetic checkpoints and tumor suppressor pathways, thus enabling oncogenic transformation. Here we show that long-term hyperglycemic conditions adversely impact the anti-tumor epigenetic mark DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) through direct regulation of the tumor suppressor and DNA 5mC hydroxymethylase, TET2. more...</span>

We show that rs117701653, a potentially causal variant for RA near CD28, overlaps open chromatin regions only after stimulation. We futhermore observe a small increase in enhancer activity for this variant under stimulatory conditions using a luciferase assay. more...</span>

Currently, there is no way to detect early diabetic nephropathy (EDN). Here we performed an unbiased assessment of gene-expression analysis of postmortem human kidneys using microarrays to identify candidate genes that may contribute to EDN.</span>

These samples were generated with MAD-DASH, a method we developed employing CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein targeting specific overabundant sequences such as adapter dimer or miRNAs to reduce these sequences from final libraries. We sequenced treated and untreated samples to demonstrate specificity, efficacy, and reproducibility of our MAD-DASH small-RNA sequencing protocol.</span>

Childhood obesity life are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, sleep disturbances and certain cancers in adulthood. Childhood obesity has become a serious global public health challenge. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important role in adipose tissue function and energy metabolism homeostasis, and abnormalities may lead to obesity. more...</span>

We found a muscle specific lncRNA we named TDNC1(T2D down-regulated non-coding RNA 1) whose expression is reduced in T2D patients as well as young individuals with family history of T2D. We used Microarray to assess for global gene expression pattern following ectopic expression of this lncRNA.</span>

We found lncRNA WAKMAR1 is significantly down-regulated in wound-edge keratinocytes from venous ulcer and diabetic foot ulcer compared to the normal wounds.

Cocoa contains a complex mixture of flavan-3-ols. Epicatechin, a major monomeric flavan-3-ol, is considered to contribute to the cardio-protective effects of cocoa.

Ten diabetic patients were submitted to a 3 hours euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken before and after the clamp. Samples from the same patients (obtained before and after the clamp) were hybridized on the same microarray. more...</span>

Recent work has demonstrated the multifaceted roles of lncRNAs in regulating mouse adipose development, but its implication in human adipocytes remain largely unknown at least partially due to the lack of a comprehensive lncRNA catalog, particularly those specifically expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT). more...</span>

Here we assessed the role of subcutaneous adipocyte lipid mobilization (lipolysis) in spontaneous long-term (&gt;10 years) body weight changes. In two independent clinical cohorts we found that low stimulated lipolysis at baseline correlated inversely with body mass index changes over time. Disturbed lipolysis gave odds ratios of ≥4.6 for weight gain and ≥3.2 for development of insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose/type 2 diabetes. more...</span>

It is an important factor in the development of diabetes mellitus (DM). According to the differences in the internal and external environment of the individual disease, BSS were divided into qi-deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (QDBS), qi-stagnation and blood stasis syndrome (QSBS), cold-coagulation and blood stasis syndrome (CCBS), heat-accumulation and blood stasis syndrome (HABS). more...</span>

We recently identified five clusters of placentas within a large gene expression microarray dataset (N=330, GSE75010), of which four contained a substantial number of PE samples. However, while transcriptional analysis of placentas can subtype patients, we hypothesized that the addition of epigenetic information should reveal gene regulatory mechanisms behind the distinct PE pathologies. more...</span>

Here we show that SRp55, a splicing factor regulated by the diabetes susceptibility gene GLIS3, has a major role in maintaining function and survival of human beta cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SRp55 regulates the splicing of genes involved in cell survival and death, insulin secretion and JNK signalling. more...</span>

Several data suggest an upregulation of the transcription factor SOX9, a progenitor and duct cell marker during ß cell dedifferentiation. However, its targets in such cells need more understanding. Here, we overexpressed SOX9 and a constitutively active mutant (VP16-SOX9∆TAD) in Human pancreatic beta EndoC-ßH1 cells in order to understand its targets.</span>

Environmental factors such as viruses play an important role in the onset of T1D and interact with predisposing genes. Recent data suggest that viral infection of human islets leads to a decrease in insulin production rather than β cell death, suggesting loss of β cell identity. more...</span>

We present a novel computational method for discovering disease-driving mechanisms acting across multiple disease-associated, non-coding genomic regions. Application to a matrix of 213 phenotypes and 1,544 transcription factor (TF) binding datasets identifies 2,264 significant associations for hundreds of TFs in 92 phenotypes, including prostate and breast cancers. more...</span>

Chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation are implicated in activation of the inflammatory response. Recently, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) have proved to reduce the severity of inflammatory diseases. We have previously shown that chromatin alterations regulated by HDACi in HepG2 cells stimulated by hyperglycemia reduced hepatic glucose production. more...</span>

The consequences of high blood glucose include damaged blood vessels, leading to arteriosclerosis and chronic diabetic microangiopathies. These changes lead to occlusive angiopathy, altered vascular permeability, or tissue hypoxia, resulting in complications such as heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, blindness, impaired wound healing, chronic skin ulcers, or amputations. more...</span>

For the analysis of genome-wide expression differences in small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and long-coding and non-coding RNAs (mRNAs and lncRNAs), NGT and GDM pregnant women were selected. Twenty-nine GDM-associated mature micro-RNAs (miRNAs) with increased expression and one hundred sixty-three mRNAs with reduced expression associated with GDM were found (P&lt;0.05 and FDR&lt;0.1).</span>

To better understand molecular pathophysiology of DFUs we used patients’ specimens and genomic profiling. We identified 3900 genes specifically regulated in DFUs. Moreover, we compared DFU to human skin acute wound (AW) profiles and found DNA repair mechanisms and regulation of gene expression among the processes specifically suppressed in DFUs, whereas essential wound healing-related processes, inflammatory/immune response or cell migration, were not activated properly. more...</span>

The features of these residual beta cells and alpha cells persisting in the islet endocrine compartment are largely unknown due to difficulty of comprehensive investigation.

While histone hyperacetylation has long been considered the paradigmatic mechanism of action, recent genome-wide profiles indicate more complex interactions with the epigenome. In particular, HDAC inhibitors also induce histone deacetylation at the promoters of highly active genes, resulting in gene suppression. more...</span>

These dysregulations were closely associated with an amplification of intestinal lipogenesis and lipoprotein output, which was triggered by insulin resistance likely sustained by oxidative stress and inflammation.

In addition, FRDA patients showed additional non-neurological features such as scoliosis, diabetes and cardiac complications. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is found in two thirds of patients at the time of diagnosis, is the primary cause of death in these patients. more...</span>

Here we describe a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from donors, spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. more...</span>

Many studies indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs) may paly critical roles in OSCC carcinogenesis, but the dynamic composition and functions of miRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks in OSCC pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Thus, detailed investigations of OSCC-associated miRNAs and their regulated networks may provide insights into mechanistic understanding of OSCC progression and development of new strategies of OSCC management. more...</span>

Therefore, gene expression in 59 human islet preparations was analyzed and correlated with diabetes reversal after transplantation in diabetic mice. more...</span>

This led to the hypothesis that epigenetic marks present at birth may predict an individual’s future risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we assessed whether epigenetic marks in blood of newborn children were associated with BMI and insulin sensitivity later in childhood. more...</span>

Exosomes are lipid vesicles derived from cellular multivesicular bodies that are enriched in specific miRNAs, potentially providing a disease-specific diagnostic signature. To assess the value of exosome miRNAs as biomarkers for T1DM, miRNA expression in plasma-derived exosomes was measured. more...</span>

We previously demonstrated that small molecules based on the isoxazole scaffold drive neuroendocrine phenotypes. The nature of the effects of isoxazole compounds on β cells was incompletely defined.  We find that isoxazole largely induced genes that support neuroendocrine and β-cell phenotypes, and suppressed a set of genes important for proliferation. more...</span>

The aim of this study was to investigate whether IR per se is characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression.  We analyzed the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two groups (10 subjects each) of healthy individuals, with extreme insulin resistance or sensitivity, matched for BMI, age and gender, selected within the MultiKnowledge Study cohort (n=148). more...</span>

The disease phenotype could be due to immature muscle cell development, which in turn may occur as the result of disturbed microRNA-mediated regulation of muscle differentiation in T2DM. To address this hypothesis, we assessed global miRNA expression during in vitro differentiation of muscle stem cells derived from T2DM patients and healthy controls. more...</span>

We aimed to assess these findings in East-Asian islet-cells. 448 islet-cells were captured from three East-Asian non-diabetic subjects for scRNA-seq. Hierarchical clustering using pancreatic cell lineage genes was used to assign cells into cell-types. more...</span>

Patients with SCM have a higher Troponin I/B-type natriuretic peptide ratio than AMI, but little is known about other circulating proteins.  The goals of this study were to compare plasma proteins in SCM and AMI to learn about the pathophysiology of SCM and also to identify putative biomarkers of SCM. more...</span>

African American (AA) individuals are disproportionately more likely to become diabetic than other ethnic groups. Over the long-term, metabolic complications related to diabetes result in significant alterations in growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Considering the limited exercise-related studies in the area of gene expression changes with disease progression, the objective of this study was to examine differences in exercise-induced gene expression related to the GH and IGF-1 pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy (CON) and PD AA individuals. more...</span>

Dysregulation of circadian gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various disorders, including hypertension, diabetes, depression, and cancer. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical modulators of gene expression post-transcriptionally, and perhaps involved in circadian clock architecture or their output functions. more...</span>

Macrophages are key innate immune regulators of inflammation that undergo 2 major directions of functional polarization: classically (M1) and alternatively (M2) activated macrophages. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of hyperglycemia on transcriptional activation of M0, M1 and M2 human macrophages.</span>

NAFLD is seen as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and affects up to 70-80% of obese patients. There are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for NASH, thus the only option is lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery in order to lose weight and to improve insulin resistance. more...</span>

We demonstrate that in mice obesity promotes the expansion of interleukin-6 receptor (IL6Ra)-expressing NK cells, which also express a number of other myeloid lineage genes such as the colony-stimulating-factor 1 receptor (Csf1r). Selective ablation of Csf1r- expressing NK cells prevents obesity and insulin resistance. more...</span>

We have investigated the mechanisms through which elevated glucose levels affect tamoxifen sensitivity of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC cells. We found that MCF7 BC cell sensitivity to tamoxifen was 2-fold reduced in 25mM glucose (HG), a concentration mimicking hyperglycaemia, compared to 5.5 mM glucose (LG), resembling normal fasting glucose levels in humans. more...</span>

Here, we show that histone deacetylase Sirt6 protects against podocyte injury through epigenetic regulation of Notch signaling. Sirt6 is downregulated in renal biopsies from patients with podocytopathies and its expression negatively correlates withglomerular filtration rate. more...</span>

In this work, we performed temporal mapping of human fetal pancreatic organogenesis using cell surface markers. We demonstrate that in the human fetal pancreas at 7 weeks of development, the glycoprotein 2 (GP2) marks a multipotent cell population that will differentiate either into the acinar, ductal and endocrine lineages. more...</span>

PDAC tumors frequently harbor the constitutively activated form of KRAS which drives proliferative signaling, but directly targeting KRAS has so far been unsuccessful. To overcome this limitation, combinatorial treatment strategies have been developed to inhibit upstream activators and downstream effectors of KRAS signaling. more...</span>

We previously found a gene-environment interaction between the paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R genotype and prenatal pesticide exposure leading to a cardio-metabolic risk profile at school age. However, the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been resolved. It has been hypothesized that epigenetics might be involved. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether DNA methylation patterns in blood cells were related to prenatal pesticide exposure level, PON1 Q192R genotype, and associated metabolic effects observed in the children. more...</span>

AF is characterized by the rapid and irregular activation of the atrium with diverse abnormalities, including electrical, structural, metabolic, neurohormonal, or molecular alterations.3 Although the pathophysiology of AF is complex, it has traditionally been treated with antiarrhythmic drugs that control the rhythm by altering cardiac electrical properties, principally by modulating ion channel function. more...</span>

Obesity is tightly associated with T2D, making it challenging to isolate specific effects attributed to the disease alone. By using an in vitro myocyte model system we were able to isolate the inherent properties retained in myocytes originating from donor muscle precursor cells, without being confounded by varying extracellular factors present in the in vivo environment of the donor. more...</span>

GDM-induced epigenetic modifications modulating gene regulation and persisting into later life are generally assumed to mediate these increased disease risks. To identify candidate genes for fetal programming, we compared genome-wide methylation patterns of fetal cord bloods (FCBs) from GDM and control pregnancies. more...</span>

Here we report that 12 weeks of high-intensity aerobic interval (HIIT), resistance (RT), and combined exercise training enhanced insulin sensitivity and lean mass, but only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. HIIT revealed a more robust increase in gene transcripts than other exercise modalities, particularly in older adults, although little overlap with corresponding individual protein abundance was noted. more...</span>

Two progenitor populations could be distinguished in omental white adipose tissue (oWAT) of morbidly obese individuals based on CD9 expression. In addition, the frequency of CD9high progenitors in oWAT correlates with oWAT fibrosis level, insulin-resistance severity and type 2 diabetes. To further gain insight into the functional differences between the CD9high and CD9low progenitor subsets, we performed transcriptomic profiling of FACS-sorted progenitor populations isolated from oWAT of obese individuals. more...</span>

MitoNEET and NAF-1 are also implicated in a number of other human pathologies including diabetes, neurodegeneration and heart disease, as well as in development, differentiation and aging. Previous studies suggested that mNT and NAF-1 could function in the same pathway in cancer cells, preventing the over-accumulation of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. more...</span>

Mapping chromatin accessibility has been widely used to identify the location of cis regulatory elements (CREs) including promoters and enhancers. CREs show tissue- and cell-type specificity and disease-associated variants are often enriched for CREs in the tissues and cells that pertain to a given disease. more...</span>

CD is often associated with several morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis/bone fractures, secondary infections, and increased cardiovascular mortality. While the majority (≈80%) of the corticotrophinomas visible on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging are microadenomas (MICs, &lt;10 mm of diameter), some tumors are macroadenomas (MACs, ≥10 mm) with increased growth potential and invasiveness, exceptionally exhibiting malignant demeanor. more...</span>

It is not diagnosed or managed properly in the majority of patients, because its pathogenesis remains controversial. In this study, using microarray-based genome-wide expression analyses, we sought to identify both common and distinct mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DM and DPN. The results demonstrated that down-regulation of the neurotrophin-MAPK signaling pathway may be the major mechanism of DPN pathogenesis, thus providing a potential approach for DPN treatment.</span>

In fact, even subtle changes of the miRnome can affect cellular functions. Therefore, changes of aging-associated miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of long-lived humans (n=24, mean age 94.8±3.9 years) and healthy, young individuals (n=24, 28.0±4.0 years) was evaluated using next generation sequencing. more...</span>

One promising approach is transdifferentiation of developmentally related pancreatic cell types including glucagon-producing alpha cells. In a genetic model, overexpression of the master regulatory transcription factor Pax4 or loss of its counterplayer Arx are sufficient to induce the conversion of alpha cells to functional beta-like cells. more...</span>

If islets produced from stem cells are to be used for transplant therapy they should precisely replicate beta-cell function. Characterization of the unique molecular mechanisms underlying the beta-cell’s response to glucose stimulation will allow a better understanding of critical elements that the alternative cells must possess. more...</span>

Novel and targetable mutations are needed for improved understanding and treatment of lung cancer in never-smokers. Methods. Twenty-seven lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers were sequenced by both exome and mRNA-seq with respective normal tissues. Somatic mutations were detected and compared with pathway deregulation, tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Results. Although somatic mutations in DNA or mRNA ranged from hundreds to thousands in each tumor, the overlap mutations between the two were only a few to a couple of hundreds. more...</span>

The aim was to assess this relationship. In a cross-sectional study, hepatic gene expression (Illumina Microarray) was first compared among 20 patients with simple steatosis (SS), 19 with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 24 healthy controls (HC). more...</span>

Pax6 is down regulated in beta-cells of diabetic db/db mice and in wild type mice treated with an insulin receptor antagonist, revealing metabolic control of expression. Deletion of Pax6 in beta-cells of adult mice leads to lethal hyperglycemia and ketosis, due to loss of beta-cell function and expansion of alpha-cells. more...</span>

In this study we examine DNA methylation at 476,366 sites throughout the genome of white blood cells from a population cohort (N = 421) ranging in age from 14 to 94 years old. Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value &lt;0.05), of which 60.5% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5% hypermethylated with increasing age. more...</span>

This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, since reliable markers are limited.  Transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, which obscures contributions from rare cell types and/or potential subpopulations. more...</span>

DNA methylation has become a useful epigenetic biomarker in part due to its susceptibility to disease influence. Detecting methylation changes in blood is important as it is an easily accessible, compared to the insulin responsive tissue skeletal muscle. more...</span>

Its molecular pathology remains poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatments. Although it has been established that multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells, all contribute to inhibition of healing, less is known regarding individual contributions of each cell type. more...</span>

Here, we invoked inDrop, a droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq method, to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two strains of mice. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare ghrelin-expressing epsilon-cells, exocrine cell types, vascular cells, Schwann cells, quiescent and activated pancreatic stellate cells, and four types of immune cells. more...</span>

Here we show that IL-6 induced STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation is enhanced in CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with T1D compared to healthy controls. Enhanced IL-6/pSTAT3 is associated with increased surface IL-6R and early clinical disease. The transcriptome of IL-6 treated CD4 T cells from T1D patients reveals upregulation of genes involved in T cell migration. more...</span>

The vast majority of cutaneous SCCs of the head and neck (cSCCHN) are readily curable with surgery and/or radiotherapy unless high-risk features are present.  Perineural invasion (PNI) is recognized as one of these high-risk features.  The molecular changes during clinical PNI in cSCCHN have not been previously investigated. more...</span>

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of 1,492 human pancreatic α-, β-, δ- and PP cells from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes organ donors. We identified cell type specific genes and pathways as well as 245 genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. more...</span>

We have identified the expression profiles of miRNAs in IDD using scoliotic nucleus pulposus as controls (GSE19943). It is noteworthy that scoliotic discs are not strictly normal discs. Therefore, the microRNA expression profiles were revisited using normal discs as control.</span>

We studied the mechanisms of this impaired exercise response in 20 middle-aged individuals who performed a controlled eight weeks cycling and walking training at 80 % individual VO2max. Participants identified as non-responders in insulin sensitivity (based on Matsuda index) did not differ in pre-intervention parameters compared to high responders. more...</span>

This is a challenging task, in particular in human tissues, because unique cell-type markers are typically unavailable, necessitating the analysis of complex cell type mixtures.

We tested the hypothesis that uncontrolled expansion of diabetogenic T-cells in patients occurs, resulting from failure to activate apoptosis. We compared function, transcriptome and epigenetic regulation thereof in relation with fate upon repeated exposure to islet-autoantigen of islet autoreactive T-cells from healthy and type 1 diabetic donors with identical islet epitope specificity and HLA-A2 restriction. more...</span>

Fetal exposure to poor environments in uterus also raises the risk of future adulthood disorders known as fetal origins of adult disease (FOAD). Epigenetic modifications like cytosine methylation and histone modification have been proposed to be involved in FOAD. more...</span>

Molecular epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded RNA that regulate post-transcriptional control of the translation of mRNA. more...</span>

After birth, islet cell growth and function are dynamically regulated; however, establishing these age-dependent changes in humans has been challenging. Here we describe a multimodal strategy for isolating pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells from children and adults to identify age-dependent gene expression and chromatin changes on a genomic scale. more...</span>

By comparing TOP1 occupancy using ChIP-Seq, versus TOP1 activity using TOP1-Seq, a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. more...</span>

Clinically, some patients suffer prematurely from ailments associated with advanced age; however, the relationship between HIV and aging is unclear. Here we have collected a large cohort of HAART treated HIV+ subjects with both recent and chronic infection and recapitulated the shared phenotype of HIV and age. To further understand this signal, we applied validated models of DNA methylation-based biological age to establish a clear link between HIV infection and molecular age advancement. more...</span>

Here we extend this approach to generate SC-β cells from Type 1 diabetic patients (T1D), a cell type that is destroyed during disease progression and has not been possible to extensively study.  These cells express β cell markers, respond to glucose both in vitro and in vivo, prevent alloxan-induced diabetes in mice, and respond to anti-diabetic drugs. more...</span>

In lower organisms, genetic “retrograde” signaling programs have been identified that promote cellular and organism survival in the face of mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we characterized the transcriptional component of the human mitochondrial retrograde response in an inducible model of mitochondrial dysfunction. more...</span>

Damages to the microvascular networks are irreversible and permanent, thus further progression of DR is inevitable. In this study, we hypothesize that multipotent perivascular progenitor cells derived from human ESCs (hESC-PVPCs) improve the damaged retinal vasculature in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rodent models. more...</span>

Notably, a growing number of lncRNAs have been implicated in disease etiology, although an association with AF has not been reported. more...</span>

Among FFAs, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), such as palmitate, have been proposed to promote inflammatory responses. Although many epidemiological studies have shown a link between periodontitis and T2D, little is known about the clinical significance of SFAs in periodontitis. more...</span>

However, their association with clinical outcome remains poorly understood. We performed large-scale miRNA and mRNA expression profiling on cryo-cut renal biopsy sections from a discovery (n=43) and a validation (n=29) cohort. In the discovery cohort (GEO Series accession number GSE45980), miRNAs differentiating stable and progressive cases were determined, and putative target mRNAs showing inversely correlated expression profiles were identified. more...</span>

CD4+ T cells are integral to the pathogenesis of T1D, but biomarkers that define their pathogenic status in T1D are lacking. miRNAs have essential functions in a wide range of tissues/organs, including the immune system. We reasoned that CD4+ T cells from individuals at high risk for T1D (pre-T1D) might be distinguished by an miRNA signature. more...</span>

Notably, destruction of one of these cell populations can stimulate repopulation via transdifferentiation of the other cell type, at least in mice, suggesting plasticity between these cell fates. more...</span>

Glucose toxicity affects pancreatic islets where it leads to β cell apoptosis. However, the role of JNK/β-catenin signaling pathway in glucotoxic β-cell apoptosis is poorly understood. To identify the potential genes whose expression changed in response to high glucose, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression in the RNAKT-15 cells for 48 h. more...</span>

At the same time, human subjects with obesity and high BMI that are otherwise insulin sensitive are an interesting group to study the underlying gene expression patterns which provide them with such protective phenotype. Objective: Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the earliest predictors of type 2 diabetes. However, diagnosis of IR is limited. more...</span>

Onset of complications (arteriosclerosis and renal damage) due to Type 2 diabetes is well documented; it is extremely important to prevent or delay their progression. Type 2 diabetes onset and progression has been controlled through dietary habits and exercise, although these remain insufficient. Chlorella ingestion improves blood glucose and cholesterol concentrations in mice and humans, although no reports have evaluated Chlorella effects in borderline diabetics. more...</span>

A small number of regulatory elements were lineage specific in both mouse and human and represented the 'core' lineage specification program.  Regulatory element acetylation levels were associated with genetic variation in humans and lineage-specific loci were enriched for autoimmune risk-alleles (especially type 1 diabetes) identified in classic and fine-resolution genome-wide association studies.</span>

Previously, we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC). more...</span>

We developed an exercise dose that activated the muscle for 0.6% of the day. The short term effects were assessed 3 hours after a single dose of exercise, while the long term effects were assessed after training 5 days per week for at least one year (adherence 81%). A single dose of electrical stimulation increased the mRNA expression of transcriptional, translational, and enzyme regulators of metabolism important to shift muscle toward an oxidative phenotype (PGC-1a, NR4A3, IFRD1, ABRA, PDK4). more...</span>

We found that extensive individual variation exists in induction of various signaling pathways.  ERK signaling displayed the greatest variation, which led to extensive variation in expression of downstream target genes. Our results suggest that phenotypic variation in kinase signaling mediates variation in downstream processes of insulin response. more...</span>

However, human islet cell expansion in culture results in loss of β-cell phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process activates expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, two members of the zinc-finger homeobox family of E-cadherin repressors, which play key roles in EMT. more...</span>

Considerable research has been conducted to accurately distinguish patients with sepsis from those with non-infectious causes of disease. Technological innovations have positioned systems biology at the forefront of biomarker discovery. Analysis of the whole-blood leukocyte transcriptome enables the assessment of thousands of molecular signals beyond simply measuring several proteins in plasma, which for use as biomarkers is important since combinations of biomarkers likely provide more diagnostic accuracy than the measurement of single ones or a few. more...</span>

Increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and activity has recently emerged as an interesting approach to not only increase energy expenditure, but also improve glucose homeostasis. BAT can be recruited by prolonged cold exposure in lean, healthy humans. Here, we tested whether cold acclimation could have therapeutic value for patients with type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity. more...</span>

Platelets play a major role, not only in the process of acute thrombosis during plaque rupture, but also in the formation of atherosclerosis itself. MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression and are expressed in a tissue and disease-specific manner. more...</span>

Toward that end, we have developed methods to highly purify a, b, and d cells from human fetal and adult pancreata by intracellular staining for the cell-specific hormone content, sorting the sub-populations by flow cytometry and, using next generation RNA sequencing, we report on the detailed transcriptomes of fetal and adult a and b cells. more...</span>

We asked whether FGF21 levels differ between subjects with metabolically healthy vs. unhealthy obesity (MHO vs. MUHO) opening the possibility that FGF21 is a cross‐talker between liver and adipose tissue in MUHO. Furthermore, we studied the effects of chronic FGF21 treatment on adipocyte differentiation, lipid storage, and adipokine secretion. more...</span>

Here we show that gene-expression profiles based on microarray analysis can be used to predict patient survival in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas. Genes most related to survival were identified with univariate Cox analysis. Using either two equivalent but independent training and testing sets, or 'leave-one-out' cross-validation analysis with all tumors, a risk index based on the top 50 genes identified low-risk and high-risk stage I lung adenocarcinomas, which differed significantly with respect to survival. more...</span>

Low dose, chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with higher risk of skin, lung, and bladder cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  While arsenic-induced biological changes play a role in disease pathology, little is known about the dynamic cellular changes due to arsenic exposure and withdrawal.  In these studies, we seek to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the biological changes induced by chronic low doses of arsenic exposure. more...</span>

Patients with DM are at high risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) that often lead to lower limb amputations, long term disability, and a shortened lifespan.

This complex disease involves systemic metabolic changes and their elucidation at the systems level requires genome-wide data and biological networks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a network-context to integrate high-throughput data. We generated myocyte-specific RNA-seq data and investigated their correlation with proteome data. more...</span>

Several factors like genetic, environmental and biochemical are involved in the development of DR. However, the inheritance pattern of this disease is multi factorial resulting from the interaction of one or more genes but the exact mechanism is not completely understood. Over the decade there has been alot of molecular genetics work done in nuclear genome for DR in different ethnic groups and  identified several candidate genes involved in disease pathogenesis but the role of these genes in the development of disease is not yet clearly understood. more...</span>

Pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) are an essential site for the development of T1D, where tolerance to pancreatic self-antigens is first broken and the autoimmune responses are amplified. The purpose of this study was to identify candidate genes and pathways in the PLN that may contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D.</span>

While efforts to identify and reduce risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease (i.e. hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, inactivity) remain the focus of primary prevention, the inability to accurately and temporally predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) impairs our ability to further improve patient outcomes. more...</span>

Substantial weight loss (-15.2+3.8%) in lifestyle participants was associated with improvement in selected cardiovascular risk factors and significant changes in peripheral blood gene expression from pre- to post-intervention: 132 unique genes showed significant expression changes related to immune function and inflammatory responses involving endothelial activation. more...</span>

However, a subset of obese people does not develop these metabolic complications. We tested the hypothesis that MNO, but not MAO, people are protected from the adverse metabolic effects of weight gain. To this end, global transcriptional profile in adipose tissue before and after weight gain was evaluated by microarray analyses.</span>

Beginning with dietary manipulation of genetically homogeneous mice, we identify differentially DNA-methylated genomic regions. more...</span>

Dysregulated expression of lncRNAs has been demonstrated being implicated in a variety of human diseases. However, there is relative paucity of information regarding the role of lncRNAs in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) hitherto. more...</span>

One promising  approach has been to increase the number or activity of brown-like adipocytes in white  adipose depots, as this has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity and reduce the  incidence and severity of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the conversion of fat-storing cells into  metabolically active thermogenic cells has become an appealing therapeutic strategy to  combat obesity. more...</span>

We aimed to identify relevant mechanisms of and search for candidate biomarkers for this endothelial damage. Human micro-vascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were exposed to bleomycin or cisplatin with untreated samples as control. 18k cDNA microarrays were used. Gene expression differences were analysed at single gene level and in gene sets clustered in biological pathways and validated by qRT-PCR. more...</span>

The potential of these cells as research tools is vast as they can be pushed to generate different cell types depending on research interest. more...</span>

However, insulin-producing cells previously generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) lack many functional characteristics of bona fide β cells. Here we report a scalable differentiation protocol that can generate hundreds of millions of glucose-responsive β cells from hPSC in vitro. more...</span>

In this study we aimed at revealing the mRNA and long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) expression patterns of pancreatic tumors that triggered PCA-DM. Four pancreatic tumors from patients with PCA-DM (A1-A4), four pancreatic tumors from patients without PCA-DM (B1-B4), and four pancreatic tissues from patients with pancreatitis were individually profiled with Agilent microarrays(Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0).</span>

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to introduce a workflow and tools for analyzing imprinted and random monoallelic gene expression in human placenta, by applying whole-transcriptome (WT) RNA sequencing of placental tissue and genotyping of coding DNA variants in family trios. more...</span>

Using a lineage tracing approach, we have demonstrated that β-cell-derived (BCD) cells rapidly dedifferentiate in culture and can proliferate for up to 16 population doublings. Dedifferentiation is associated with changes resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). more...</span>

Their therapeutic use and characterization, however, is limited by their scarce availability in the peripheral blood of tumor-free donors. In the present study we describe and characterize a novel population of myeloid suppressor cells, named fibrocytic MDSC (f-MDSC), that are differentiated from umbilical cord blood (UCB) precursors by a 4 day culture with FDA approved cytokines (rh-GM-CSF and rh-G-CSF). more...</span>

However, the role of the methylation-induced RRAD inactivation in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, the Ras regulated-transcriptome and epigenome were profiled by comparing T29H (a RasV12-transformed human ovarian epithelial cell line) with T29 (an immortalized but non-transformed cell line) through Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS-seq) and Digital gene expression (DGE) . more...</span>

Despite the recent advance in the treatment of PDR such as vitreoretinal surgery with use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drug as an adjunct, it still remains vision-threatening disease.

However, clinical and immunologic phenotypes of T1DM are variable. Several auto-antibodies including GADA, IA-2A, and ZnT8A, were identified in T1DM, but the prevalence of these auto-antibodies varied for a broad spectrum of T1DM. Here, we systemically profiled auto-antibodies from serum samples of 16 T1DM, 16 type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients, and 27 healthy controls with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) using protein microarrays containing 9,480 proteins. more...</span>

Cell-cell communication between the maternal endometrium and the pre-implantation embryo can occur by several means. Here, we show that maternal miRNAs are secreted by the endometrial epithelium to the endometrial fluid. Microarray assessments revealed the presence of specific miRNAs that are associated with the window of implantation and therefore in direct contact with the human preimplantation embryo. more...</span>

To test the hypothesis that resistance to aerobic exercise training underlies metabolic disease-risk, we used selective breeding for 15 generation to develop rat models of low- and high-aerobic response to training. more...</span>

Previously, we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC). more...</span>

However, it is unknown to what extent this modulation is achieved through DNA methylation. We assessed the effects of cholesterol intake, the proportion of energy intake derived from fat, the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to saturated fatty acids (SFA), the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to SFA, and the ratio of (MUFA+PUFA) to SFA on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in normal-weight and obese children. more...</span>

Resveratrol, a natural compound with anti-inflammatory properties, is shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese mice and humans. Here we tested the effect of a 2-year resveratrol administration on the pro-inflammatory profile and insulin resistance caused by a high-fat, high-sugar (HFS) diet in white adipose tissue (WAT) from rhesus monkeys. more...</span>

Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of T1D in recent years, the non-genetic component has remained poorly defined. We hypothesized that epigenetic variation could underlie some of the non-genetic component of T1D aetiology and, thus, performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for this disease. more...</span>

Intriguingly, human pancreatic islets express many complement genes. The most highly expressed gene was the complement inhibitor CD59 that is GPI anchored to the cell membrane, which unexpectedly was found in high amounts intracellularly in beta cells. Silencing of CD59 strongly suppressed insulin secretion. more...</span>

Emerging evidence implicates changes in placental function in altered fetal growth and the subsequent development of adult disease.  The susceptibility for disease in response to an adverse intrauterine environment differs distinctly between boys and girls, with girls typically having better outcomes. more...</span>

We also examined the gene expression patterns for 2 female hIPSCs (derived from different disease model fibroblasts) that were also negative for XIST RNA. hiPS 12D-1 is derived from Huntington's Disease patient and 6C-1 is derived from a Type I Diabetes Mellitus patient (Park et al Nature 2008).</span>

Differences were subtle, but widespread and reproducible in an independent validation cohort. The transcriptional consequences of differential DNA methylation were further defined by genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis and validated in two independent cohorts. more...</span>

To determine if microRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of human T2DM, we sequenced the small RNAs of human islets from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified a cluster of miRNAs in an imprinted locus on human chromosome 14q32 that is highly and specifically expressed in human β-cells and dramatically down-regulated in islets from T2DM organ donors. more...</span>

Our purpose was to identify miRNAs altered in the human diabetic cornea by microarray analysis, and to examine their effects on wound healing in cultured telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) in vitro. Using microarrays, 29 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in diabetic samples. more...</span>

The aim of this subchallenge was to verify that it is possible to extract a robust diagnostic signature from gene expression data that can identify stages of different types of lung cancer. Participants were asked to develop and submit a classifier that can stratify lung cancer patients in one of four groups – Stage 1 of Adenocarcinoma (AC Stage 1), Stage 2 of Adenocarcinoma (AC Stage 2), Stage 1 of Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC Stage 1) or Stage 2 of Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC Stage 2). more...</span>

The objective of the present study was to gain more insight into the effects of 30 days resveratrol supplementation on adipose tissue morphology and underlying processes. Nine healthy obese men were supplemented with placebo and 150mg/day resveratrol for 30 days, separated by a 4-week washout period. more...</span>

We hypothesize that these changes exist prior to OLT and may play a role in the development of renal failure after OLT. We use gene expression microarrays to investigate the mechanism of kidney disease in patients listed for OLT. Gene expression profiles of biopsies of cirrhotic patients were compared with pre-implantation living donor biopsies. more...</span>

Prototypic natural Treg (nTreg) are programmed by Forkhead-box P3 (FOXP3) and can be reliably identified by demethylation at the FOXP3 locus. To explore the nTreg methylation landscape we performed genome-wide methylation studies on human naïve resting nTreg (rTreg) and conventional naïve CD4+ T cells (Naïve). We detected 2,315 differentially methylated CpGs between these two cell types, many of which clustered into 127 regions of differential methylation (RDMs). more...</span>

Using ChIP sequencing and RNA sequencing analysis, we determined the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of human pancreatic α, β, and exocrine cells. We found that, compared with exocrine and β cells, differentiated α cells exhibited many more genes bivalently marked by the activating H3K4me3 and repressing H3K27me3 histone modifications. more...</span>

We used three different types of human adipose tissue (epigastric, visceral, and subcutaneous) in order to determine differences in global gene expression between these adipose depots in severely obese patients.

In fetal tissues genome-wide epigenetic changes are likely to occur with specific long term and even trans-generational effects. We have utilized this model to study the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the transcriptome and to verify the presence of specific epigenetic changes associated to chronic HG in vascular cells.</span>

In this report we discuss a heterozygous mutation in the first coding exon of the proto-oncogene Ha-Ras (Ha-RasA11P) that we have identified in a patient with familial premature aging syndrome. The patient has atopic sklerodermic skin alterations, insulin resistance as well as disturbances in lipid metabolism. more...</span>

The ubiquitous immediate-early gene c-fos is one essential transcription factor to initiate adipocyte differentiation. In a CGL patient we identified a single homozygous point mutation in the promoter of c-fos gene. The mutation facilitates the formation of a novel specific protein/ DNA complex and ubiquitously reduces basal and inducible c-fos transcription activity. more...</span>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important component of regulatory control, and have proven roles in the development of human disease and control of glucose homeostasis. We set out to establish the miRNA profile of human pancreatic islets and of enriched beta-cell populations, and to explore their potential involvement in T2D susceptibility. more...</span>

In an effort to fill this gap, we have applied a novel bioassay to both human and BB rat T1D whereby the complex milieu of inflammatory mediators present in plasma can be indirectly detected through their ability to drive transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells drawn from healthy, unrelated donors. more...</span>

To determine whether stem cell derived-beta cells faithfully reflect the phenotypes of a diabetic subject, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from diabetic subjects (MODY2) with heterozygous loss-of-function of the gene encoding glucokinase (GCK). more...</span>

Resulting from ongoing transcription, these modifications in turn, may provide instant feedback to the transcription machinery.

Microarray study of human circulating leukocytes sampled before, 1 hour after and 2 hours after glucose ingestion was performed. The present study demonstrated 36 genes which showed acute gene expression change in human leukocytes within 1 hour after glucose ingestion and suggest that leukocytes participate in the inflammatory process induced by acute hyperglycemia.</span>

Most of these patients are treated with platinum-based chemotherapies, but there is no biomarker model to guide their responses to these therapeutic agents.   We have developed and independently tested our novel multivariate molecular predictors for forecasting patients' responses to individual drugs on a cohort of 58 ovarian cancer patients. more...</span>

One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding  to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in 6 human cell lines. We identified 116,000 non-redundant TCF7L2 binding sites, with only 1,864  sites common to the 6 cell lines. more...</span>

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore specific biomarkers that can differentiate pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes from type-2 diabetes for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. In the current study, we used global gene transcription analysis with affymetrix gene chip to identify genes specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes mellitus from peripheral blood samples in stead of from tissue samples.</span>

It has also recently been found that mtDNA haplogroups are distinctively associated with susceptibility to T2DM at least in Koreans and Japanese. To investigate the functional consequences of different mtDNA, we compared gene expression profiles between cybrid clones harboring three different mtDNA haplogroups (D5, F, and N9a). more...</span>

Indeed, effective HF therapy in diabetic patients requires a complex strategy encompassing the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic markers and innovative pharmacological approaches. Whole mRNAs expression was measured in the heart of patients with heart failure (HF) with or without concomitant Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  and compared it to control non-failing hearts. more...</span>

Here we treated 10 healthy, obese men with placebo and 150 mg/day resveratrol in a randomized double-blind cross-over study for 30 days. Resveratrol supplementation significantly reduced sleeping- and resting metabolic rate. more...</span>

However, definitions of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small for gestational age (SGA) are based on simple statistical approaches that may misclassify infants with a normal developmental profile and vice versa. We used an unbiased global profiling approach to identify gene expression patterns in umbilical cord tissue from 38 infants and identified a set of 466 genes which separated the subjects into 2 distinct groups – one biased towards lower birth weight and one biased towards normal birth weight. more...</span>

Sequence-influenced methylations were described in T2DM-associated genomic regions, but evidence for direct, sequence-independent association with disease risk is missing. Here we explore disease-contributing DNA methylation through a stepwise study design: first, a pool-based, genome-scale screen among 1,169 case and control individuals revealed an excess of differentially methylated sites in genomic regions that were previously associated with T2DM through genetic studies. more...</span>

Such cells, carrying the patient's genome, might be useful for cell replacement. Here we report that the development of human oocytes activated after genome exchange invariably arrests at the late cleavage stages in association with transcriptional abnormalities. more...</span>

Fixation with formalin, a widely adopted procedure to preserve tissue samples, leads to extensive degradation of nucleic acids and thereby compromises procedures like microarray-based gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that RNA fragmentation is caused by activation of RNAses during the interval between formalin penetration and tissue fixation. To prevent RNAse activation, a series of tissue samples were kept under-vacuum at 4°C until fixation and then fixed at 4°C, for 24 hours, in formalin followed by 4 hours in ethanol 95%. more...</span>

Additionally, the offspring of older parents are at significantly increased risk of cancer, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Only a proportion of these increased risks among the children of older parents can be attributed to nondisjunction and chromosomal rearrangements. more...</span>

Our study design was guided by the hypothesis that the expression of genes present in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) but not in healthy oral tissues would be indicative of recurrence in advance of histological alteration. more...</span>

Despite similar propensities for obesity, Hispanics and African Americans exhibit unique and distinct differences in obesity related outcomes such as greater risk of, obesity-related cancers in AA and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Hispanics. This study was aimed to determine whether differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression in obese, Hispanic and AA young adults might explain ethnic differences in obesity-related phenotypes.</span>

However, while evidence supports the replicative capacity of adult beta cells in vivo, attempts at expanding human islet cells in tissue culture resulted in loss of beta-cell phenotype. Using a genetic lineage-tracing approach we have provided evidence for massive proliferation of beta-cell-derived (BCD) cells within these cultures. more...</span>

These included changes in genes regulating lipid and steroid metabolic processes and electron carrier activity in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).  Additional genes involved in metabolic processes and mitochondrial function were found to be up-regulated in the adipose tissue of HIV-positive patients compared with HIV-negative controls.</span>

Using a human hepatoma cell line (Huh7), we investigated the changes in lipid homeostasis and gene expression when the synthesis of ceramide is perturbed by knocking down serine transferases subunits 1, 2 and 3 (SPTLC123) or dihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS1). While the inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPTLC) affects ceramide production differently at the subspecies level depending upon which SPTLC subunit is silenced; depleting DEGS1 is sufficient to produce a similar outcome as knocking down all SPTLC subunits. more...</span>

Adipose tissue samples were collected from children having elective surgery (n=71, [54 boys], 6.0 +- 4.3 years). Affymetrix microarrays (n=20) were performed to characterize the functional profile and identify genes of interest in adipose tissue. Visceral adipose tissue had an overrepresentation of Gene Ontology themes related to immune and inflammatory responses and subcutaneous adipose tissue had an overrepresentation of themes related to adipocyte growth and development. more...</span>

While the transcriptional program that initiates adipogenesis is well-known, the importance of microRNAs in adipogenesis is less well studied. We thus set out to investigate whether miRNAs would be actively modulated during adipogenesis and obesity. Several models exist to study adipogenesis in vitro, of which the cell line 3T3-L1 is probably the most well known, albeit not the most physiologically appropriate. more...</span>

Surprisingly, we find that a very large fraction of genes show some level of acetylation on H3K56, but the highest levels of acetylation are associated with genes previously reported to be involved  in type 2 diabetes. more...</span>

Th1 lymphocytes are responsible for the infiltration of the islets of Langerhans and for the cytokine release that supports cytotoxic (Tc) lymphocytes to mediate destruction of the beta cells. The preclinical disease stage is characterized by the generation of the self-reactive lymphocytes that infiltrate the pancreas and selectively destroy the insulin-producing beta cells present in the islets. more...</span>

However, molecular mediators of insulin resistance remain unclear. We find that the top-ranking gene set in expression analysis of muscle from humans with T2D and normoglycemic insulin resistant subjects with parental family history (FH+) of T2D is increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator MKL1. more...</span>

Here we map INS-associated loci in human  pancreatic islets by 4C and 3C techniques and show that the INS gene physically  interacts with the SYT8 gene, located over 300 kb away. This interaction is  elevated by glucose and accompanied by increases in SYT8 expression.  Inactivation of the INS promoter by promoter-targeting siRNA reduces SYT8  gene expression. more...</span>

To test their effect in humans, we monitored for 22 years Ecuadorian individuals who carry mutations in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene that lead to severe GHR and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) deficiencies. We combined this information with surveys to identify the cause and age of death for individuals in this community who died before this period. more...</span>

In this study, we compared the expression profiles of miRNAs in blood samples from Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and T2D male patients with tissues from T2D rat models. Healthy adult males with no past history of T2D (n=158) and with desirable cholesterol and blood pressure profiles were enrolled in this study. more...</span>

Notably, we have uncovered an arsenic-induced “suppressorome” - a complex of 17 known and putative tumor suppressors silenced in human cancers. more...</span>

In light of this, and contradicting reports regarding discordant copy number profiles between MZ twins(BARANZINI et al. 2010; BRUDER et al. 2008), we set out to identify de novo somatic copy number mutations in DNA from blood for MZ twin pairs of Mexican American descent who were participants of the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) or San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder study (SAFDGS). more...</span>

The World Health Organization anticipates that these numbers will double in the next 20 years. Metabolic syndrome is a well recognized set of symptoms that increases a patient’s risk of developing diabetes.  Insulin resistance is a factor in both metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by decreased insulin stimulated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, decreased adiponectin levels, increased adipocyte  FFA and cytokine production, and increased insulin and hepatic glucose output. more...</span>

However, a growing number of recent studies provide data that mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of T2DM development. The aim of our study is to clarify in further detail the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in T2DM by a comprehensive ex vivo analysis of mitochondrial function combined with global gene expression analysis in muscle of pre-diabetic newly diagnosed untreated T2DM subjects and long-standing insulin treated T2DM subjects compared with age- and BMI-matched controls. more...</span>

With no known ligand and few known target genes, the mode of TR4 function was unclear. We report the first genome-wide identification and characterization of TR4 in vivo binding. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified TR4 binding sites in 4 different human cell types and found that the majority of target genes were shared among different cells. more...</span>

We conducted genome-wide analysis of DNase I hypersensitive sites, histone H3 lysine methylation marks (K4me1, K4me3, K79me2), and CCCTC factor (CTCF) binding in human islets. This identified ~18,000 putative promoters (several hundred novel and islet-active). more...</span>

Of these defects, incomplete migration resulting in ectopic thyroid tissue is the most common (up to 80%). We obtained flashfrozen samples of ectopic thyroid tissue removed from 3 girls aged 8, 10 and 15 yr, because it caused local symptoms. more...</span>

Human embryonic stem (hES) cells possess unlimited self-renewal and pluripotency and thus have the potential to provide an unlimited supply of different cell types for tissue replacement. The hES-T3 cells with normal female karyotype were first differentiated into embryoid bodies and then induced to generate the pancreatic islet-like cell clusters, which expressed pancreatic islet cell-specific markers of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin. more...</span>

While multiple pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of DN, there are no specific treatments for DN and currently it is not possible to predict DN onset or progression. To examine gene expression signatures related to DN, microarray experiments were performed on a subset of human sural nerves collected during a 52-week clinical trial of acetyl-L-carnitine. more...</span>

We examined the effect of nine days of bed rest on basal and insulin stimulated expression of genes potentially involved in insulin action by applying hypothesis-generating microarray in parallel with candidate gene real-time PCR approaches in 20 healthy, young men. Furthermore, we investigated whether bed rest affected DNA methylation in the promoter region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) gene. more...</span>

However, the associated peripheral cytokine milieu is frequently dilute and difficult to measure, necessitating development of more sensitive and informative biomarkers for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, and monitoring therapeutic interventions. Previously, we have shown that sera from type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induces a unique disease-specific pro-inflammatory transcriptional profile in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to sera of healthy controls. more...</span>

To identify hepatic secretory proteins involved in insulin resistance, we performed liver biopsies in humans with or without type 2 diabetes and conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles.</span>

Several genes have been identified with key relevance for glomerular function. Quite a few of these genes show a specific or preferential mRNA expression in the renal glomerulus. To identify additional candidate genes involved in glomerular function in humans we generated a human renal glomerulus-specific transcript dataset (GTD) by comparing gene expression profiles from human glomeruli and tubulointerstitium obtained from six transplant living donors using Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. more...</span>

However, it is not known whether insulin itself could increase the transcription of specific genes for cellular proliferation in the endothelium. Hence, the characterization of transcriptional modifications in endothelium is an important step for a better understanding of the mechanism of insulin action and the relationship between endothelial cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. more...</span>

However, to date no study is available regarding the relationship of miRNAs expression profile, biological pathway and cellular phenotype during human adipogenesis. Thereby, the aim of this study was to investigate whether miRNA expression profile in human adipocytes is related to adipogenesis and to test whether miRNA profile in human subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated to human obesity and co-morbidities. more...</span>

They were then classified according to fasting glucose levels to have T2D, IFG or as healthy controls (CTL), for comparison of miRNA expression profiles. more...</span>

Patients with these chronic conditions have a higher incidence of various cancers, more aggressive tumors, and a higher mortality rate. It has been proposed that obesity, inflammation and chronic disease should be correlated with cancer at the molecular level, but common gene signatures or networks have yet to be described. more...</span>

In high-risk subjects, the earliest detectable abnormality is insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Impaired insulin-mediated signaling, gene expression, and glycogen synthesis, and accumulation of intramyocellular triglycerides have all been linked with insulin resistance, but no specific defect responsible for insulin resistance and DM has been identified in humans. more...</span>

Failure to restore homeostasis in the ER is associated with human diseases. To identify the underlying changes in gene expression in response to ER stress, we induced ER stress in human B-cells and then measured gene expression at 10 time-points. more...</span>

The laser capture microdissection technique was used to acquire beta-cells from pancreatic tissue sections obtained from type 2 diabetic (T2D) and non-diabetic controls. We found that 4% of analyzed transcripts were differentially expressed between the two groups at the lower confidence bound cutoff of 1.2, and, among the differentially expressed transcripts, 62% were up-regulated and 38% down-regulated in samples of T2D subjects compared to non-diabetic controls. more...</span>

We hypothesized that this biological memory is mediated by permanent alterations of the epigenome in stem cell populations.  Our studies focused specifically on DNA methylation in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from cord blood, and utilized a two-stage design involving genome-wide discovery followed by quantitative, single-locus validation. more...</span>

Patients with type 1 diabetes have reduced levels of endothelial progenitor cells of which their functional capacity is impaired. Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and increased oxidative stress play a role in endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction in these patients. Folic acid, a B-vitamin with anti-oxidant properties, may be able to improve endothelial progenitor cell function. more...</span>

To gain an insight into the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in aberrant energy metabolic status and pathogenesis of NAFLD, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs in livers of ob/ob mice, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice and normal C57BL/6 mice by miRNA microarray. Compared to normal C57BL/6 mice, ob/ob mice showed up-regulation of 8 miRNAs and down-regulation of 4 miRNAs in fatty livers. more...</span>

Using a combination of genetic/genomic and bioinformatics approaches, we identified a large number of genes that were both differentially expressed between American subjects self-identified to be of either African or European ancestry and that also contained single nucleotide polymorphisms that distinguish distantly related ancestral populations. more...</span>

The amygdala is a key structure in the brain’s emotional system and in recent years the crucial importance of the amygdala in drug-seeking and relapse has been increasingly recognized. In this study gene expression screening was used to identify genes involved in alcoholism in the human basolateral amygdala. The results show that alcoholism affects a broad range of genes and many systems including genes involved in synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter transport, structural plasticity, metabolism, energy production, transcription and RNA processing and the circadian cycle. more...</span>

Cells out of the pocket depth of the inflamed peri-implant and periodontal ligament as well as from the middle third of healthy periodontal ligament were applied. Genome-wide gene expression was compared with the help of microarray analysis, and the data were validated by real-time RT-PCR. more...</span>

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein, is an acute phase reactant that induces vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) migration and proliferation in areas of vascular injury, and is also upregulated in VSMCs exposed to hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia amplifies the expression of genes induced by TSP-1 in VSMCs. more...</span>

In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. more...</span>

In vitro expansion of beta cells from mature human pancreatic islets provides an alternative source of insulin-producing cells. The exact nature of the expanded cells produced by diverse expansion protocols, and their potential for differentiation into functional beta cells, remain elusive. more...</span>

NSCLC is also associated with a high rate of relapse following clinical treatment and therefore requires robust prognostic markers to better manage therapy options. The aim of this study was to identify miRNA expression profiles in squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) of the lung that would better predict prognosis.</span>

Septicemia is the most common presentation of the disease with 40% mortality rate even with appropriate treatments. Faster diagnostic procedures are required to improve therapeutic response and survival rates. We have used microarray technology to generate genome-wide transcriptional profiles (&gt;48,000 transcripts) of whole blood obtained from patients with septicemic melioidosis (n=32), patients with sepsis caused by other pathogens (n=31), and uninfected controls (n=29). more...</span>

Elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids are a biochemical hallmark of obesity.  Unlike plants and bacteria, mammals cannot utilize fatty acids to generate glucose because of the lack of glyoxylate shunt enzymes. Instead, fatty acids are used for energy storage, and their utilization is regulated at multiple levels ranging from hormonal to metabolic ensuring that glucose is preferentially oxidized before fatty acids. more...</span>

It has been proved that miRNAs play important roles in many biological processes.

Studies have shown that thiazolidinediones (TZD) improve metabolic disturbances in PCOS patients. We hypothesized that the effect of TZD in PCOS is in part mediated by changes in the transcriptional profile of muscle favoring insulin sensitivity.  Using Affymetrix microarrays, we examined the effect of pioglitazone (30 mg/day for 16 weeks) on gene expression in skeletal muscle of 10 obese women with PCOS metabolically characterized by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. more...</span>

Nine metabolic syndrome patients were recruited to 48 workouts of interval training. At the end of the study, all patients significantly reduced their risk of cardiovascular disease (in terms of VO2max, blood pressure and plasma lipid).

STUDY DESIGN: We compared gene expression profiles of 1st (45-59 days) and 2nd trimester (109-115 days), and C-section term placentae. RESULTS: In 1st trimester placentae, genes related to cell cycle, DNA, aminoacids and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly overrepresented, while genes related to signal transduction were downregulated. more...</span>

We investigated the effects of comprehensive periodontal therapy on gene expression of peripheral blood monocytes. Approximately 1/3 of the patients showed substantial changes in expression in genes relevant to innate immunity, apoptosis, and cell signaling. We concluded that periodontal therapy may alter monocytic gene expression in a manner consistent with a systemic anti-inflammatory effect. more...</span>

We tested the hypothesis that the transcriptional adaptation to aging differs in males and females using a monkey model, which is not only physiologically and phylogenetically closer to humans than the more commonly studied rodent models, but also is not afflicted with the most common forms of vascular disease that accompany the aging process in humans, e.g., atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. more...</span>

In the present study, we hypothesized that decreased expression of OXPHOS genes could be of similar importance for insulin resistance in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 expression array from Affymetrix, we analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from obese women with PCOS (n=16) and age- and body mass index-matched control women (n=13) metabolically characterized by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and indirect calorimetry. more...</span>

The abstract of this manuscript follows here: Background Investigations performed in mice and humans have acknowledged obesity as a low-grade inflammatory disease. Several molecular mechanisms have been convincingly involved in activating inflammatory processes and altering cell composition in white adipose tissue (WAT); however, the overall importance of these alterations, and their long-term impact on the metabolic functions of the WAT and on its morphology, remain unclear. more...</span>

White adipose tissue (WAT) was recently shown to be the site of substantial interstitial fibrosis. ECM components, such as fibronectin, and their receptors integrins control cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Adipocyte differentiation which is under the control of a specific transcriptional network is associated with decrease of fibronectin-rich matrix. more...</span>

We performed euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (80 mU/m2/min) clamps in 12 healthy, insulin sensitive subjects with no family history of diabetes followed by biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle taken basally and after 30 and 240 minutes of insulin infusion. more...</span>

We hypothesized that the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in maintaining the cellular and extracellular integrity would be altered in cases of pelvic organ prolapse. more...</span>

High-risk populations include women with diabetes, dyslipidemia, thrombotic disorders, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypertension, renal diseases, previous preeclampsia, twin pregnancies, and low socioeconomic status. In the latter case, the incidence may increase to 20% to 25%. Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. more...</span>

PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, and is characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. This disease is frequently associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and defects in insulin secretion, predisposing these women to type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. more...</span>

To define the set of insulin-regulated genes in human skeletal muscle, we analyzed the global changes in mRNA levels during a 3-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in vastus lateralis muscle of six healthy subjects. Using 29,308 cDNA element microarrays, we found that the mRNA expression of 762 genes, including 353 expressed sequence tags, was significantly modified during insulin infusion. more...</span>

Furthermore, HNF1beta overexpression has been observed in clear cell cancer of the ovary. To identify potential HNF1beta target genes whose activity may be deregulated in human patients we established a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) expressing HNF1beta conditionally. more...</span>

A portion of this gene expression profile reflects family resemblance rather than the actual presence of an autoimmune disease.  Here we wanted to identify that portion of this gene expression pattern that is independent of family resemblance and determine if it is a product of disease duration, disease onset, or other factors. more...</span>

Muscle also rapidly remodels in response to training and innervation. Muscle weakness and wasting is important in such conditions as aging, critical care medicine, space flight, and diabetes. Finally, muscle can also be used to investigate systemic defects, and the compensatory mechansisms invoked by cells to overcome biochemical and genetic abnormalities. more...</span>
