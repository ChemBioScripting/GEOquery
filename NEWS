version 2.47.1

  Bug fixes:
    * Fixes problems with intermittent connection issues
      (which were not intermittend connection problems,
      it seems)

version 2.45.2

  Improvements:
    * GPL parsing 4-5x faster
    * GSM parsing 3x faster
    * GSEMatrix parsing is much smarter with respect to
      sample characteristics. In short, for GSEs where
      sample characteristics are actually used, the
      pData should have nice, neat column headers with
      the phenodata keys and values in the columns,
      including correct handling of missing values, etc.
